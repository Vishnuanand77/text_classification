You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.,1.

" It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting.

" It only last 1 year and i couldn't find where to get the free 18 months replacement that appears on the warranty. I sent emails to Exide Batteries, and have no answers... it is incredible what a scam these batteries are and there is no warranty, nobody will replace your battery or your money back. Yesterday, the battery on my car died, it was another brand from walmart it last 2 years and 10 months, i just went to the store WITHOUT receipt of purchase,and still got a new one for 2.06$ !!!! and still with 3 years of free replacement!!

" The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! ",1. Correct

Everyone else was sold out... our kids love riding in their power wheels!  Great battery life and we're going to get another for the other power wheels we have!,1. Correct
" If quality matters to you, and you are looking for an authentic UB1250 battery by Universal Power Group, Inc. (UPG), then buyer beware of this listing.  I rcvd a   Sigma Tek   battery of unknown quality instead of a UB1250.  You can get knock-off brands (i.e. Sigmas Tek) cheaper elsewhere. I hope this meets Amazon's review criteria, since it is about the product I rcvd, just too bad it wasn't the same as advertised.  I would expect that from Ebay, but not Amazon. Can't warn you about the seller (Amazon won't let me here), but their name abbreviated is a good description of their Bait-and-Switch tactics. ",1. Correct
