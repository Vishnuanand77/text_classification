{"review": " It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting.

{"review": " The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.
