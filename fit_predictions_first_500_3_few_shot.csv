You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.,Wrong Size
" It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting.

" It only last 1 year and i couldn't find where to get the free 18 months replacement that appears on the warranty. I sent emails to Exide Batteries, and have no answers... it is incredible what a scam these batteries are and there is no warranty, nobody will replace your battery or your money back. Yesterday, the battery on my car died, it was another brand from walmart it last 2 years and 10 months, i just went to the store WITHOUT receipt of purchase,and still got a new one for 2.06$ !!!! and still with 3 years of free replacement!!

" The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! ",Correct Size/

" If quality matters to you, and you are looking for an authentic UB1250 battery by Universal Power Group, Inc. (UPG), then buyer beware of this listing.  I rcvd a   Sigma Tek   battery of unknown quality instead of a UB1250.  You can get knock-off brands (i.e. Sigmas Tek) cheaper elsewhere. I hope this meets Amazon's review criteria, since it is about the product I rcvd, just too bad it wasn't the same as advertised.  I would expect that from Ebay, but not Amazon. Can't warn you about the seller (Amazon won't let me here), but their name abbreviated is a good description of their Bait-and-Switch tactics. ",Wrong Size
" This battery does not have F2 terminals. They are F1, and two small converters change the F1 to F2. One converted quickly and easily, the other took some work and pliers. I would have prefered a battery with F2 terminals as this one was described, as I specifically did NOT order a battery with converters. Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.  But the battery fits and works well, just wish it was as described. ",Wrong Size:

" Husband bought this for his motorcycle, and lasted one ride. Next time he went to start the bike, it was dead, and the battery would not charge.  He use to work on motorcycles, so he knows the procedures on how to install a battery in a motorcycle and how to charge them properly before installed in the bike.  So this battery was a dud. There was a no return policy, so I wasted my money. Would not recommend this product from this seller.  VERY VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. And this is the first time I have EVER given a bad review.

" I was a bit worried about ordering a battery from Amazon especially after the poor review and date problem listed below but, our travel trailer battery was dead and after checking local prices (whew!) decided to give this a try.After reading all the reviews, opted for this one and then noticed, WarehouseDeals had one available for a few bucks less. Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was   uh-oh   because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh!

" My low battery alarm started going off in the middle of the night, and then proceeded to do it every night until I replaced it. Very  Annoying!For some reason, I failed to select expedited shipping, but that wasn't a problem because the vendor shipped it the next day. Since I live in the same state, I got it the day after that. This alone warranted the 5 star rating for me as I couldn't get the battery warning to stop. The manual failed me.The battery arrived as an exact match of the original; exactly as pictured. The original battery lasted almost 13 years. Hopefully this will last as long too.After installation, my system did not immediately clear the Low Battery warning. It didn't continue to alarm, but did still show it on the consoles. This worried me at first. Sometime during the night, the system apparently did a battery check and noticed that it was fine.The battery was packaged well for shipping. Box just large enough. Enough, but not too much, bubble wrap with just a single piece of tape to cut to get at the new battery. No packaging wounds from this product/company. ",Correct Size/

" I ran this battery connected to a Minn Kota 30lb thrust trolling motor, pushing an 8 foot Zodiac raft on a lake.  The battery lasted a total of approximately 5-1/2 hours and 5-1/2 miles before losing most of its power. Most of the setting ran on the trolling motor was 1 and 2 from 5 selections (5 being highest output) We did encounter some head winds for some of this time.  I emailed my findings to VMAX and they replied back promptly that the conditions I gave them and the life of the battery was about what was to be expected.  Personally I think I was expecting a little more battery life.  Now that I know what to expect I can better judge how close I should be to the boat ramp before losing power!  Rowing blows....  Compact design and weight make it great to handle.  Small posts on terminals required some additional washers to hold the trolling motor connectors more securely. ",Correct Size/

" UPDATE 2/05/12 - Amazon is allowing me to return all six reels I bought with them paying postage, even though I bought them nearly a year ago. I have no need for spools of fake copper wire made out of 95% aluminum.UPDATE 2/03/12 - just today I became aware of the review by Kyle A. Stein, to see it click on the reviews of the black color of this same wire, BC4B-100.  He reports that it only has a trace of copper and it's mostly aluminum. I will be contacting Amazon about possible fraud.________________________________________________  now back to original review from early 2011:I just took delivery on a spool of this in black and a spool of it in red, and I'll describe it here... but first, I'd like to ask anyone out there if this is really copper wire.IS IT?Amazon is a nice buying experience usually, but in some cases - like this - there is no way to get a quick answer to a question, I don't know if I should return it or not.The wire is silvery-color instead of copper-color.  Now this could be because it's plated in silver or tin, which would be ok, or it could be that it's steel wire, which would not be OK.  Wish me luck in figuring that out.  The description claims it to be copper wire, but it is not copper color.It is also not what one usually thinks of as battery cable, which is that fairly-rigid stuff that battery cables are made out of. This has much finer strands, and to my eye looks a lot narrower in the total strands than 4 gauge battery cable.It is limp as a noodle, also unlike normal battery cable, and I assume it is more for installing stereo systems than being used as robust battery cable.Any recommendations out there for how I can tell? I think I'll probably be returning it, because it simply isn't regular battery cable wire.  But I might keep it IF it turns out to be copper wire. ",Wrong Size

Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.

It also works well for coating wherever the negative cable connects to the frame on an older truck or full framed car.

This morning I used it for the first time and it WORKED !!! Never again will I be late to work due to a dead battery. (I have a phantom parasitic draw no one can find - goes dead overnight).  I am so happy with this purchase... delivery was speedy...had it within 3 days.  The only feature I would have liked added, would be a light. Otherwise, I found it easy to use. This is the same model the tow-truck drivers used to bring...I'll miss those good ol' boys! There are other fancier geegaws out there, but many of them just don't have the power to start a completely dead battery.  The JNC 660 does! I recommend it for piece of mind. ",Correct Size/
I have even used this to start my dodge 2500 which has a heavy duty battery for starting and it worked great. The light pulls out to expose a 12v car adapter socket.,Correct Size/
" Amazing!  I jump-started my car no fewer than ten times without recharging this thing, and each time was pretty much an instant start.  It probably would have been good for a few more starts, but the electrical problems that I was trying to ignore caught up with me and I had to spend a bunch of money at the mechanic.  But that's my problem. The point is that this thing packs an amazing amount of power, and it's easy to use. Nice! ",Correct Size/
Have not had to use it yet - but I know how handy it is to have it available. Thanks,Wrong Size
" Last week driving my Nissan Quest the kids left some lights on and the battery died.  Lucky for me a friend had a portable battery charger.  It was about 3 degrees outside so I was really lucky.  That got me thinking that I really needed to get one.  After some research I decided to go with the JNC300XL.  It had the most reviews and for the price I seemed like a good deal to me.  I received this on Wednesday 1/22/14.  I was sick so I was unable to charge it until afternoon of 1/23/14.  It charged for about 18 hours, then Friday 1/24/14 (today) my wife woke me up.  Said the battery was dead in the other van.  I checked the charge indicator on this unit and it was 3/4.  I hooked it up to the van and bam was able to start the van right up.  I know people are not 100% sure how to hook up the jumper cables.  I've 100% of the time hook up the red (+)  and the black (-) to the battery terminals.  I don't ground the black to the car, and 100% of the time I'm able to crank over the car.  I've never had an issue with sparking etc.  I've helped my friends and I show up and I see how they have the jumper cables hooked up and they are having a hard time jumping their own car, and I have them shut everything off, then hook up the cables directly, and bam jump the car.  Take it for what it's worth.Pros:- didn't take long to charge the internal battery before jumping my car- light weight- AC adapter to charge the battery easy to use (some require you to use a extension cord)- Design (like the way they give you a nice safe way to clamp your cords to the pack. Helps with them to not accidently touch and helps prevent any foreseeable fire damage by crossing.Cons:Non yet I've only owned this unit for 3 days. ",Correct Size/
" Work at a dealership, charged maybe once every month, clamps a little large   have to leave attached to battery on some vehicles for 30-45 seconds before it will jump off. Won't work on some newer vehicles with high CCA rated batteries, but, when it won't, have yet to borrow someone's that will. Small, lightweight and value cannot be beaten. ",Wrong Size
I love this car jumper  It is very powerful and reliableMy car started right up when using this model. Plus it is at a great price  Not like the junk they sell at Walmart which by the way is more expensive,Correct Size/
We have 4 of these.  Amazon had the best price by about 60$ versus here in the town I live in. Back in the late 80's my dad bought me a much lesser unit for 109$.  I have found this enough to jump start my diesel when the batteries failed in it.  My dad has had two of these for a couple years for his trucks too.,Correct Size/
" As a female, I have always had problems using the usual heavy jump starters.  When I saw this one, I said  #34;perfect #34;.  But would it work as well as the giant ones I had been using?  absolutely!  It  performs even better than the others.  It balances on the engine, doesn't fall over and stores well in a small  space.  I highly recommend this product. ",Correct Size/
" I already had a JNC 660 for my truck and wanted to put smaller units in each of our cars. I bought 3 of these, then 2 more for Christmas gifts. They are easy to use and much more dependable than the cheap imports with lots of whistles and bells.... I prefer the larger unit for my dodge 1500 with a V-8 (I've jumped it 5 or 6 times between charges without a problem... electrical trouble...) This smaller unit is great for our Toyota 4 cylinder cars and Chrysler Concorde with a 3.5 6 cylinder. These beat the heck out of jumper cables, and my daughter and wife don't have to ask strangers for help... or wait for AAA. ",Correct Size/
" Perhaps the engine of an older Mercedes is too large for it to manage, but fully charged, even trying the method suggested by other unhappy purchasers - connecting both leads to the battery - did not work. Frustrating for a not inexpensive product. ",Wrong Size
this is worth having if you need a jump it beats using another car.there are a lot of these on the market do your homework and buy a good one.,Wrong Size
" I have bought a couple of department store booster packs in the past and they never seem to last more than 2-3 years. I decided to do a little research and invest in a high quality one. I found this one on amazon and I love it. It is very durable, holds a charge for a ridiculously long time and can provide multiple boosts on a single charge. I wish I had found this sooner instead of wasting money on the cheap department store ones I had in the past.One thing to note is that It doesn't have built in reverse polarity protection so make sure you connect the leads to the right battery terminal (eg. positive to positive). It sounds like a no-brainer, but I was I wasn't paying attention one night and connected them in reverse and blew the main fuse on a vehicle that I was boosting. So the car had to sit there till the next day when I could come back with a new fuse. Oops! Needless to say I pay more attention when I connect this starter now. I think I prefer it without the idiot-proof reverse polarity protection.  Keep it simple and avoid additional electronics.This thing has been extremely useful for me, and provides peace of mind in the cold winter mornings. I showed it to my mechanic and now he has one, what do you know? ",Correct Size/
" This is a must have for the professional technician. No more wasting time looking for the shop's jumper, grab it out of your tool box and feel confident that it will start just about anything on the lot. This replaced an older version of the Jump N Carry 300 XL I previously owned for about 15-20 years (yes, it lasted that long). Great tool at a great price. I highly recommend it. ",Correct Size/
I have used my jump-n-carry to jump my car twice this last month during cold weather and even helped to jump start a friends moped. I plugged it back in after each use and it was at full charge after 20 minutes or so. Worked wonderfully every time!Really nice and compact. Solid feel and build. Couldn't be happier with my purchase.,Correct Size/
" I chose this item because of the reviews   the dimensions.It is sleek   compact   fits in tight places for those who are limited in trunk space.I am dismayed that the instructions warn that temperatures above 70 o   below 68 o affects the amperage. Based on this, how it performs or how often one has to recharge it is yet to be seen.I feel it is a bit pricey too   should have included other options such as an ac inverter, air compressor   maybe a light as the smaller unit.I bought a MVP 600  10 yrs ago. It was 1/2 the price   if I had to recharge it every 6 mths,that was alot!! Loved it! Couldn't find a replacement anywhere.Hope this unit proves to be worth the bucks. PS,as per Clore,should you buy an inverter( max 400 watts) ,don't attach any tool w/more than 6.3 amps. ",Wrong Size
" This is a great jump starter because it's consistent and reliable. There are only two issues to consider:(1) There is no indicator to let you know when the unit has been fully charged, so you have to keep an eye on it.(2) The unit MUST be stored upright. Otherwise, the instructions say it could leak battery acid. This is a little more inconvenient, if you want to store it in your car. ",Wrong Size:

" This unit worked initially.  I hadn't used it for awhile and went to charge it and it was dead.  Neither charger would work.  LEDs flashed once and then nothing.  The units is out of warranty so I am going to throw it away.  This unit was kept in the trunk of my car and had been periodically charged.  It has only jump started a car once.I took it apart to see if the problem was something obvious (I am an electrical engineer) but other than some bad solder joints nothing was apparent.  With an known good charger connected,  the battery voltage is about 3.5V.  Either the battery has an internal short or the charger circuit has failed... or both.  The internal circuit breaker was not open.Good thing I had taken it in to charge it and didn't find out how junky it is when i really needed it!Addendum (2/24/2014).  I disconnected appropriate wires internally and tried to charge the battery with a standard auto battery charger/starter at both 2A and 10A charge rates.  After 36 hours the battery had crept up to about 8.5V indicating the battery is bad.  Whether the charger circuit is also bad (or caused the battery failure) I do not know.  The unit is in the trash now! ",Wrong Size

my very experienced mechanic said these bearings are the best made in china....euro type quality for a good price....the install went well..the bearings are silent...,Correct Size/
" Like the other reviewers on here I was thrilled to find this part for the listed price.  However, I only got about 30k out of this bearing.  It might very well be the exception to the rule and, in fairness, I paid very little for the part compared to other options.  Having said that, had I the opportunity to do it over again, I would spend the extra to get a part that would last longer.  Pulling these out is no picnic and having to do it twice in such a short period of time (or pay someone to do it) ruins the advantage of the low price. ",Wrong Size:
" I accidently ordered the wrong hub assembly for the left side of my truck and it was shipped immediately! We went over what the Vin specified,but I guess my truck is a little different. I also got the credit for the wrong part quickly as well. Great customer service! ",Wrong Size
" I've learned my lesson to just stick with OEM parts for replacements. This wheel bearing for my wifes '05 Saturn Ion 2 was no exception. As usual, the descriptions from ACDelco weren't that great, and I wasn't sure if it should get the bearing with or without the abs sensor. Glad I got the one with the sensor. When I removed the old bearing, the old sensor stuck in the knuckle, and was all gunked up. Popped the old sensor out, cleaned everything up, lubed with never seize, and reassembled. Worked perfect.

" I installed this hub.  It turned off my service traction control light, and abs light.  I thought all was good until the bearing starting squealing on the way to the alignment shop.  I torqued the bolts to specs.  I installed a new hub bearing from autozone.  It is having the same problem.  It seems that it wasn't the cause. ",Wrong Size
Defies logic.  Nothing in the ad says they will ship 3 so I ordered two thinking there was one in a box.  Now I have 6 total.  I can't imagine why there would be three.  Two would make some sense.Other than that they are dust caps.  They go round and round with the rotor.  They keep the dust out and the grease in.  Pretty functional overall.,Wrong Size:

I bought this hub in May of 2012. This only lasted less then one year I had to replace it in March of 2013. On top of paying for the shipping to me in 2012 which was 11.00 dollars when it failed I had to return it back to the seller which cost me 21.00 dollars sending it through the USPS. I would recommend paying the high price of the OEM styles pay the money once and be money ahead and happy.

" I installed this part on my 2001 Honda Odyssey about a year ago, and it's been working great ever since. The one on the other side is now failing, so I'll be ordering another to complete the pair.

" I just installed these bearings. They were  #34;snug #34; but fit well. The retaining bolts that hold them were a challenge these are on the backing plate (nothing to do with the new bearings). Make sure you put WD-40 or something like it on the center bolts and the nuts that hold the plate. Made a difference on the car's handling, much tighter (96k on Buick Park Ave). Oh yes, and make sure you tighten the center nut (this one must be really tight). You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;. I tried to buy them locally, and no one has them in stock, you get a new one if you order the whole hub assembly. These bearings from Timkin are the way to go, spend the extra for these so hopefully you don't get to do it again anytime soon.If you don't have a lift rack (I don't) figure about 2 hours a side.

The bearing seems to fit and function properly. the install was simple I would advise a 2 arm puller on the next attempt. only because of heat and corrosion due to the failed bearing.
