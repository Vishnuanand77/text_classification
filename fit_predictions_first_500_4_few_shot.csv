You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.,Wrong Size
" It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting.

" It only last 1 year and i couldn't find where to get the free 18 months replacement that appears on the warranty. I sent emails to Exide Batteries, and have no answers... it is incredible what a scam these batteries are and there is no warranty, nobody will replace your battery or your money back.

" The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! ",Correct Size/

" If quality matters to you, and you are looking for an authentic UB1250 battery by Universal Power Group, Inc. (UPG), then buyer beware of this listing.  I rcvd a   Sigma Tek   battery of unknown quality instead of a UB1250.  You can get knock-off brands (i.e. Sigmas Tek) cheaper elsewhere. I hope this meets Amazon's review criteria, since it is about the product I rcvd, just too bad it wasn't the same as advertised.  I would expect that from Ebay, but not Amazon.

" This battery does not have F2 terminals. They are F1, and two small converters change the F1 to F2. One converted quickly and easily, the other took some work and pliers. I would have prefered a battery with F2 terminals as this one was described, as I specifically did NOT order a battery with converters. Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.  But the battery fits and works well, just wish it was as described. ",Wrong Size:

" Husband bought this for his motorcycle, and lasted one ride. Next time he went to start the bike, it was dead, and the battery would not charge.  He use to work on motorcycles, so he knows the procedures on how to install a battery in a motorcycle and how to charge them properly before installed in the bike.  So this battery was a dud. There was a no return policy, so I wasted my money. Would not recommend this product from this seller.  VERY VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. And this is the first time I have EVER given a bad review.

" I was a bit worried about ordering a battery from Amazon especially after the poor review and date problem listed below but, our travel trailer battery was dead and after checking local prices (whew!) decided to give this a try.After reading all the reviews, opted for this one and then noticed, WarehouseDeals had one available for a few bucks less. Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was   uh-oh   because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh!

" My low battery alarm started going off in the middle of the night, and then proceeded to do it every night until I replaced it. Very  Annoying!For some reason, I failed to select expedited shipping, but that wasn't a problem because the vendor shipped it the next day. Since I live in the same state, I got it the day after that. This alone warranted the 5 star rating for me as I couldn't get the battery warning to stop. The manual failed me.The battery arrived as an exact match of the original; exactly as pictured. The original battery lasted almost 13 years. Hopefully this will last as long too.After installation, my system did not immediately clear the Low Battery warning. It didn't continue to alarm, but did still show it on the consoles. This worried me at first. Sometime during the night, the system apparently did a battery check and noticed that it was fine.The battery was packaged well for shipping. Box just large enough. Enough, but not too much, bubble wrap with just a single piece of tape to cut to get at the new battery. No packaging wounds from this product/company. ",Correct Size/

" I ran this battery connected to a Minn Kota 30lb thrust trolling motor, pushing an 8 foot Zodiac raft on a lake.  The battery lasted a total of approximately 5-1/2 hours and 5-1/2 miles before losing most of its power. Most of the setting ran on the trolling motor was 1 and 2 from 5 selections (5 being highest output) We did encounter some head winds for some of this time.  I emailed my findings to VMAX and they replied back promptly that the conditions I gave them and the life of the battery was about what was to be expected.  Personally I think I was expecting a little more battery life.  Now that I know what to expect I can better judge how close I should be to the boat ramp before losing power!  Rowing blows....  Compact design and weight make it great to handle.  Small posts on terminals required some additional washers to hold the trolling motor connectors more securely. ",Correct Size/

" UPDATE 2/05/12 - Amazon is allowing me to return all six reels I bought with them paying postage, even though I bought them nearly a year ago. I have no need for spools of fake copper wire made out of 95% aluminum.UPDATE 2/03/12 - just today I became aware of the review by Kyle A. Stein, to see it click on the reviews of the black color of this same wire, BC4B-100.  He reports that it only has a trace of copper and it's mostly aluminum. I will be contacting Amazon about possible fraud.________________________________________________  now back to original review from early 2011:I just took delivery on a spool of this in black and a spool of it in red, and I'll describe it here... but first, I'd like to ask anyone out there if this is really copper wire.IS IT?Amazon is a nice buying experience usually, but in some cases - like this - there is no way to get a quick answer to a question, I don't know if I should return it or not.The wire is silvery-color instead of copper-color.  Now this could be because it's plated in silver or tin, which would be ok, or it could be that it's steel wire, which would not be OK.  Wish me luck in figuring that out.  The description claims it to be copper wire, but it is not copper color.It is also not what one usually thinks of as battery cable, which is that fairly-rigid stuff that battery cables are made out of. This has much finer strands, and to my eye looks a lot narrower in the total strands than 4 gauge battery cable.It is limp as a noodle, also unlike normal battery cable, and I assume it is more for installing stereo systems than being used as robust battery cable.Any recommendations out there for how I can tell? I think I'll probably be returning it, because it simply isn't regular battery cable wire.  But I might keep it IF it turns out to be copper wire. ",Wrong Size

Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.

It also works well for coating wherever the negative cable connects to the frame on an older truck or full framed car.

This morning I used it for the first time and it WORKED !!! Never again will I be late to work due to a dead battery. (I have a phantom parasitic draw no one can find - goes dead overnight).  I am so happy with this purchase... delivery was speedy...had it within 3 days.  The only feature I would have liked added, would be a light. Otherwise, I found it easy to use. This is the same model the tow-truck drivers used to bring...I'll miss those good ol' boys! There are other fancier geegaws out there, but many of them just don't have the power to start a completely dead battery.  The JNC 660 does! I recommend it for piece of mind. ",Correct Size/
I have even used this to start my dodge 2500 which has a heavy duty battery for starting and it worked great. The light pulls out to expose a 12v car adapter socket.,Correct Size/
" Amazing!  I jump-started my car no fewer than ten times without recharging this thing, and each time was pretty much an instant start.  It probably would have been good for a few more starts, but the electrical problems that I was trying to ignore caught up with me and I had to spend a bunch of money at the mechanic.  But that's my problem. The point is that this thing packs an amazing amount of power, and it's easy to use. Nice! ",Correct Size/
Have not had to use it yet - but I know how handy it is to have it available. Thanks,Wrong Size
" Last week driving my Nissan Quest the kids left some lights on and the battery died.  Lucky for me a friend had a portable battery charger.  It was about 3 degrees outside so I was really lucky.  That got me thinking that I really needed to get one.  After some research I decided to go with the JNC300XL.  It had the most reviews and for the price I seemed like a good deal to me.  I received this on Wednesday 1/22/14.  I was sick so I was unable to charge it until afternoon of 1/23/14.  It charged for about 18 hours, then Friday 1/24/14 (today) my wife woke me up.  Said the battery was dead in the other van.  I checked the charge indicator on this unit and it was 3/4.  I hooked it up to the van and bam was able to start the van right up.  I know people are not 100% sure how to hook up the jumper cables.  I've 100% of the time hook up the red (+)  and the black (-) to the battery terminals.  I don't ground the black to the car, and 100% of the time I'm able to crank over the car.  I've never had an issue with sparking etc.  I've helped my friends and I show up and I see how they have the jumper cables hooked up and they are having a hard time jumping their own car, and I have them shut everything off, then hook up the cables directly, and bam jump the car.  Take it for what it's worth.Pros:- didn't take long to charge the internal battery before jumping my car- light weight- AC adapter to charge the battery easy to use (some require you to use a extension cord)- Design (like the way they give you a nice safe way to clamp your cords to the pack. Helps with them to not accidently touch and helps prevent any foreseeable fire damage by crossing.Cons:Non yet I've only owned this unit for 3 days. ",Correct Size/

I love this car jumper  It is very powerful and reliableMy car started right up when using this model. Plus it is at a great price  Not like the junk they sell at Walmart which by the way is more expensive,Correct Size/
We have 4 of these.  Amazon had the best price by about 60$ versus here in the town I live in. Back in the late 80's my dad bought me a much lesser unit for 109$.  I have found this enough to jump start my diesel when the batteries failed in it.  My dad has had two of these for a couple years for his trucks too.,Wrong Size
" As a female, I have always had problems using the usual heavy jump starters.  When I saw this one, I said  #34;perfect #34;.  But would it work as well as the giant ones I had been using?  absolutely!  It  performs even better than the others.  It balances on the engine, doesn't fall over and stores well in a small  space.  I highly recommend this product. ",Correct Size/
" I already had a JNC 660 for my truck and wanted to put smaller units in each of our cars. I bought 3 of these, then 2 more for Christmas gifts. They are easy to use and much more dependable than the cheap imports with lots of whistles and bells.... I prefer the larger unit for my dodge 1500 with a V-8 (I've jumped it 5 or 6 times between charges without a problem... electrical trouble...) This smaller unit is great for our Toyota 4 cylinder cars and Chrysler Concorde with a 3.5 6 cylinder. These beat the heck out of jumper cables, and my daughter and wife don't have to ask strangers for help... or wait for AAA. ",Correct Size/
" Perhaps the engine of an older Mercedes is too large for it to manage, but fully charged, even trying the method suggested by other unhappy purchasers - connecting both leads to the battery - did not work. Frustrating for a not inexpensive product. ",Wrong Size.

" I have bought a couple of department store booster packs in the past and they never seem to last more than 2-3 years. I decided to do a little research and invest in a high quality one. I found this one on amazon and I love it. It is very durable, holds a charge for a ridiculously long time and can provide multiple boosts on a single charge. I wish I had found this sooner instead of wasting money on the cheap department store ones I had in the past.One thing to note is that It doesn't have built in reverse polarity protection so make sure you connect the leads to the right battery terminal (eg. positive to positive). It sounds like a no-brainer, but I was I wasn't paying attention one night and connected them in reverse and blew the main fuse on a vehicle that I was boosting. So the car had to sit there till the next day when I could come back with a new fuse. Oops! Needless to say I pay more attention when I connect this starter now. I think I prefer it without the idiot-proof reverse polarity protection.  Keep it simple and avoid additional electronics.This thing has been extremely useful for me, and provides peace of mind in the cold winter mornings. I showed it to my mechanic and now he has one, what do you know? ",Correct Size/
" This is a must have for the professional technician. No more wasting time looking for the shop's jumper, grab it out of your tool box and feel confident that it will start just about anything on the lot.

I have used my jump-n-carry to jump my car twice this last month during cold weather and even helped to jump start a friends moped.

" I chose this item because of the reviews   the dimensions.It is sleek   compact   fits in tight places for those who are limited in trunk space.I am dismayed that the instructions warn that temperatures above 70 o   below 68 o affects the amperage. Based on this, how it performs or how often one has to recharge it is yet to be seen.I feel it is a bit pricey too   should have included other options such as an ac inverter, air compressor   maybe a light as the smaller unit.I bought a MVP 600  10 yrs ago. It was 1/2 the price   if I had to recharge it every 6 mths,that was alot!! Loved it! Couldn't find a replacement anywhere.Hope this unit proves to be worth the bucks. PS,as per Clore,should you buy an inverter( max 400 watts) ,don't attach any tool w/more than 6.3 amps. ",Wrong Size
" This is a great jump starter because it's consistent and reliable. There are only two issues to consider:(1) There is no indicator to let you know when the unit has been fully charged, so you have to keep an eye on it.(2) The unit MUST be stored upright. Otherwise, the instructions say it could leak battery acid. This is a little more inconvenient, if you want to store it in your car. ",Correct Size/

" This unit worked initially.  I hadn't used it for awhile and went to charge it and it was dead.  Neither charger would work.  LEDs flashed once and then nothing.  The units is out of warranty so I am going to throw it away.  This unit was kept in the trunk of my car and had been periodically charged.  It has only jump started a car once.I took it apart to see if the problem was something obvious (I am an electrical engineer) but other than some bad solder joints nothing was apparent.  With an known good charger connected,  the battery voltage is about 3.5V.  Either the battery has an internal short or the charger circuit has failed... or both.  The internal circuit breaker was not open.Good thing I had taken it in to charge it and didn't find out how junky it is when i really needed it!Addendum (2/24/2014).  I disconnected appropriate wires internally and tried to charge the battery with a standard auto battery charger/starter at both 2A and 10A charge rates.  After 36 hours the battery had crept up to about 8.5V indicating the battery is bad.  Whether the charger circuit is also bad (or caused the battery failure) I do not know.

" Like the other reviewers on here I was thrilled to find this part for the listed price.  However, I only got about 30k out of this bearing.  It might very well be the exception to the rule and, in fairness, I paid very little for the part compared to other options.  Having said that, had I the opportunity to do it over again, I would spend the extra to get a part that would last longer.  Pulling these out is no picnic and having to do it twice in such a short period of time (or pay someone to do it) ruins the advantage of the low price. ",Wrong Size

" I've learned my lesson to just stick with OEM parts for replacements. This wheel bearing for my wifes '05 Saturn Ion 2 was no exception. As usual, the descriptions from ACDelco weren't that great, and I wasn't sure if it should get the bearing with or without the abs sensor. Glad I got the one with the sensor. When I removed the old bearing, the old sensor stuck in the knuckle, and was all gunked up. Popped the old sensor out, cleaned everything up, lubed with never seize, and reassembled. Worked perfect.

Defies logic.  Nothing in the ad says they will ship 3 so I ordered two thinking there was one in a box.  Now I have 6 total.  I can't imagine why there would be three.

I bought this hub in May of 2012. This only lasted less then one year I had to replace it in March of 2013. On top of paying for the shipping to me in 2012 which was 11.00 dollars when it failed I had to return it back to the seller which cost me 21.00 dollars sending it through the USPS.

" I just installed these bearings. They were  #34;snug #34; but fit well. The retaining bolts that hold them were a challenge these are on the backing plate (nothing to do with the new bearings). Make sure you put WD-40 or something like it on the center bolts and the nuts that hold the plate. Made a difference on the car's handling, much tighter (96k on Buick Park Ave). Oh yes, and make sure you tighten the center nut (this one must be really tight). You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;. I tried to buy them locally, and no one has them in stock, you get a new one if you order the whole hub assembly. These bearings from Timkin are the way to go, spend the extra for these so hopefully you don't get to do it again anytime soon.If you don't have a lift rack (I don't) figure about 2 hours a side.

" I had read other reviews about the plastic fittings offered by other vendors and to stay away.  When I removed the leaking elbows from the engine I understood why.  Each one snapped off exactly where the O-ring sits.  If you are looking for a short term repair spend a couple dollars less and buy plastic.  If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.

" I bought my truck second hand and always assumed my actuator was unplugged or the motor was bad.  I started comparing prices and shopped the usual stores online like Autozone, Advance Auto and Pep Boys, only to discover that the aftermarket items had no rain shield or bracket, and instructions on Youtube indicated you'd need to take the bracket off of your old one and transfer it to the new part, however I'd discovered mine was missing, so there was no old part to rob the necessary parts from.  That's when I started searching for the factory OEM replacement part in hopes that it would be complete.  As usual I shopped around for the best deal and after finding the correct part number I did a more specific search.  Amazon's price was far below both the aftermarket and OEM part I found elsewhere, and it also had the rain shield.  It was an exact fit, installation was a breeze, and I didn't even need the pop rivets that are also included as I used sheet metal screws instead.  It works great and it's so nice to be able to hit the remote now as it was the driver's side, and it came in handy today because I live in the tropics and there was a deluge of flooding rain and I would have been soaked if I had to stand there fumbling with my keys.

" My driver's side vent temperature on my 99 Park Ave was stuck on full hot since January, spring has rolled around and finally had to do something about it. I replaced the temp door actuator and... still stuck on hot... bummed me out but I did some more research which lead me to to do the following.  With the ignition key off I unplugged the AC/Heater programmer module (its located behind the glove box with a couple of big wire harness connectors plugged into it, access it by lowering the black panel underneath the glove box) and let it power down for a couple of minutes. With the key still off I reconnected both connectors, then turned the key to on for 3 minutes, without starting the engine. This process clears any codes that were stored in the module and forces it to go through a door position   learn   test, which properly activated the actuator and now my dual zone climate controls are functioning normally once again!  Wish I'd known about the relearn procedure before I started, might have saved me the cost of an actuator... but it did quit working properly for some reason, and it may have only delayed my purchase a few days before it failed again.

" There is a known problem on some Government Motors (GM) products, including Chevy Silverado trucks, of the ABS falsely activating at low speeds while decelerating from approximately 7 to 3 mph. Although this is not a major safety hazard making the truck undriveable, it is extremely annoying, almost as annoying as the costly GM bailout, LOL! Fortunately it is easy to correct without spending billions of taxpayer dollars. It is caused by an error in the front wheel speed sensors.These ACDelco sensors are the exact OEM item, and Amazon actually sells them for a lower price than some aftermarket substitutes. Replacement, while not a 15-minute breeze, is a pretty basic operation using the usual automotive tools. With the vehicle jacked up on safety stands and the front wheel removed, follow the normal procedure to remove the caliper, and then remove the rotor. The sensor is held into the hub with one Allen screw, and there is one electrical plug to disconnect, and then it's out.It is absolutely essential to be sure the mating surface on the bearing hub is immaculately cleared of any rust, using sandpaper, Scotchbrite or wire brush. Even a very thin layer of rust can prevent the sensor from seating properly and cause errors. Be sure the mounting hole is free of sanding debris. Spraying a light coat of rust preventive paint on the cleaned surface may help prevent the rust from re-appearing. Put it all back together, and then you'll have smooth stops and can quit cringing when you step on the brake pedal.The vehicle's OBD-II system may have stored a code relating to this error even after the repair. This can be cleared using a Scantool. If you don't have one, you can buy it from Amazon. ",Wrong Size:
" ABS Code checks at my local Autozone narrowed my problem down to my left rear hub. The rear hubs on this 2002 Buick Lesabre have the speed sensors built into the hubs and it is the rotation of the speed sensor which provides feedback to the ABS controller. There are a number of conditions which can trigger an ABS code and in my case there was a fluctuation in the DC voltage going to the left rear wheel sensor. A quick way of checking the voltage at the sensor connector is to measure the voltage at both female connections in the harness which plugs into the sensor. If the vehicle has the original speed sensor connections, one wire will be black and one wire will be white. The DC voltage on the white wire side should be less than 4.0 V DC and the black wire may show just a trace amount of voltage less than about 0.04 mV DC. I had a steady 4.0 V DC on the right side hub, but the left side kept fluctuating between 2.0 and 4.0 V DC. Initially, I thought I had a bad speed sensor in my new left hub, so I replaced the hub under warranty. Nothing lost, since I can now change out a hub in 30 minutes or less! Thinking I had a bad Delphi connector, which after several hours of searching in the Delphi catalog ended up being Connector Body P/N 12052638, Connector Seal P/N 12048086, Terminal P/N 12048074, Lock P/N 12052634, and some 20 AWG black and white multistrand wire, I ended up soldering and crimping a replacement pigtail connector which actually fit the connector mounted on the wheel hub. I spliced in my replacement pigtail and hoped the ABS light would go off. After a short test dive to get over 5 MPH, I heard the familiar 'ding' of the ABS light coming on and I thought it was best to replace the enter wheel speed sensor assembly. Initially, I was going to pull out the existing wheel speed sensor wiring harness but since GM had mounted this wiring harness to the vehicle frame before they attached the body, I simply cut the old harness ends off and ran the new wiring harness alongside the existing wiring harness using wire ties to keep the new harness in place along the vehicle frame. I plugged in the new harness to the wheel sensors, took the car for a spin, and no more ABS or Traction control light. After dissecting the old wiring harness to get to the root cause of my intermittent voltage, I found that a previous vehicle owner had spliced in about a 6 inch section of larger gage wire into the white wire which was going to the left rear speed sensor. This additional resistance was enough to affect the voltage at the sensor which triggered the ABS code. This larger wire was spliced in about 10 inches beyond where I had made my splice joint and if I had found it earlier during an inspection of the wiring harness, my custom made pigtail would have fixed the problem. In the end the $90 I paid for a replacement wiring harness was worth the money since I have now learned so much about wheel hubs, ABS sensors, wiring harnesses, and Delphi connectors.

I really like these pads. There is a coating on the back side to keep em' quiet. No need to put expensive silicone grease on the back side. The ceramic pad broke in fast and should last a long time. I put them on a 2000 Mercury Sable and they fit up real nice.Bob,Correct Size/

" Great price for these pads from Amazon than a big name auto part store and when I went to check on price point at (big name auto parts store) their pads were in bad shape with the coating peeling and cracking off the back plates from what appears to have been long time storage and moving.  I have been using Wagner Thermoquiets on all of my vehicles for the past 9-10 years to replace factory pads.

" I have been previously using ceramic brake pads from Advanced Auto Parts, so this time around I decided to use ceramics for the front, these for the rear. I am comparing these to my previous setup, I'm not a brakes pro or professional mechanic, but I know how to do proper maintenance.Like other semi-metallic brake pads these get your wheel dirty with all the brake powder, and also these wear out quicker then ceramic. Ceramic brake pads are not suppose to be work as good unless your braking a lot to heat them up, but compared to the mess these makes and their life, ceramics would be better. Now this is just a generic review, it isn't comparing other semi-metallic brake pads, these was good for the price. And you could go through a couple of these before you got to the price ceramic ones, so that part is positive, and OEM brake pads are usually semi-metallic. ",Wrong Size

" Compared to the price the dealer wanted for pads, this is a steal. I bought the rotors and pads, had my mechanic install them and saved myself over $400 over what the dealer wanted to charge. It is a crime the way car dealers and some brake shops rip people off for simple repairs. I have no problem with them making a buck, but marking labor and parts up 400% is just not right. How many naive drivers are throwing money away every day because they do not realize how simple and inexpensive brake work is. If I would have had the time, I would have installed them myself. It took the mechanic less than an hour for rotors and pads, probably would have taken me twice that, but I would have saved even more. I just don't like predator pricing. Anyway, the mechanic was very impressed with the quality and the price of the pads. I've been stopping smoothly, quietly and quickly ever since! ",Wrong Size:
" I've had these pads on the front of my '02 Honda Civic Si for over a year and a half and they seem to be durable, without noticeable wear.  The braking performance is very much improved over the stock pads, most notably, the Initial bite.  These pads do produce more dust than the stock pads, but it is acceptable given the improved performance.  I run white painted wheels in the summer and the dust is reasonable even given my choice of wheels.  There isn't any braking noise to speak of.  My only complaint is a minor groove that has appeared around the center of the right rotor (EBC Ultimax).  I will buy these pads again in the future. ",Wrong Size:

" I haven't actually installed these yet, but wanted to point out that the packaging for this product is terrible. The shoes (4) are loose in the box so that they bang against each other until the customer receives them. Two of the four shoes I received were damaged. Haven't decided it I'm going to return them yet as the damage may not be a big enough problem. Essentially, the damage amounts to a corner of one of the shoe pads that had been hit and broken off (about the size of a penny) and another shoe pad had been that had been nicked pretty hard on one edge.The main fault lies with the manufacturer in that they should secure the shoes so that they can't bang against each other in shipment, but Amazon didn't do much either in that the brake shoe box was loose inside the bigger Amazon box (the lone air pillow inside was flat, should have been several more).I had also purchased some disk brake pads from the same manufacturer in a separate order which, though packaged the same way, managed to make the trip without any real damage.I gave the product 4 stars only because the shoes are supposed to be good.

" I bought these to measure my wife's biceps, yeah laugh away but tape measures aren't very good foraccuracy and I'm used to verniers.These are plastic and that's what you want on the human body, not steel and these look to be accurate towithin .5mm which is what I wanted.The larger one will only measure to 6   even tho it is marked to 7   the slide sticks after 6   andis unusable.These are ok for small measurements but feel flimsy as you move out past 4  .The 3   vernier slide, slides right off and falls on the floor if you aren't careful.Also the 3   has no thumb hold which is probably because it's very small and no way will you measure out to 3  !I wouldn't trust it past 2  .The 6   vernier has a small metal rod for stability.Overall it's ok but should cost less, and actually measure out to 7   not 6  .Love measuring in milimeters, main reason I bought this was because it measured in cm/mm.Also these are waterproof and even stainless steel verniers are really not waterproof.So it depends what you want to use this for. If you are a machinist this is laughable for accuracy.For carpentry it's ok, and for measuring body parts it's good since 1mm is as close as you are going to get anyway.This set should cost about 2 bucks not more than double that, like I paid.That's why I rated it 3 stars.

Why mess around with C clamps when you can pick this wonderful tool up for $35~ and not damage your car or hands!

" I'm going to purchase this tool because I needed it yesterday. I've never had to deal with these type of brake calipers in the past and was at a loss when my C-clamp wouldn't compress the caliper in. My local Hyundai dealer called me about my other vehicle that was in the shop for more serious repair when I told him I was working on my other Hyundai and couldn't get the rear calipers compressed. He was happy to tell me how to use a pair of needle nose pliers to help screw them in. I will say it was so difficult to keep the pliers spread apart to fit the slots and I kept loosing my grip. It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in. Not sure why I had to screw them OUT to get them IN but it worked. Anyway, after dealing with that I decided that I will be purchasing a tool next time to make it easier and I think this tool will do the trick. I don't really care if it's precision made like another commenter said it needed to be. Hey, as long as it makes it easy to wind them back in right?

" Pros - Good stainless construction.  Stainless banjo fittings and the kit comes with all new hardware.

" I purchased both the large and small universal adapters in order to bleed my S2000s brake and clutch master cylinders.  At first look after I initially received both items - I thought there was a mistake due to the fact they looked to be the same size.  I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder.

" Overall, this kit worked for my 2004 Toyota Sequoia. All of the springs and hold-down parts seemed to be an exact match of what I had on my car. However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are. ",Wrong Size

 I bought these for my 2010 F150 along with the brake pads. The pads fit but these rotors did not. I used the Amazon parts finder that told me these were correct. At 1st glance the diameter is correct but the bolt pattern was wrong. The product may be just great but if they don't fit I can't judge. So my review gives 3 stars because they are the wrong size. Of course I had the truck pulled apart before I noticed. Then I had to run into town and buy the correct rotors from the local NAPA store at 5PM on a Saturday.

" Like other's have stated, this Stant #10504Y (Yellow) locking Gas Cap did not come up as compatible with my vehicle, but the Stant #10504 (Black) Gas Cap did show compatible.  I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.  So I ordered the yellow cap as my Terrain came with an original Yellow Gas cap since it can use E-85.  I have never put E-85 in my vehicle, but wanted to keep things a near as original as possible.  I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase. ",Wrong Size:

" As far as overflow bottle caps go, this one is one of the better built in a sea of copycat units.  Mine was built in Germany, but your mileage may vary.  The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted! ",Wrong Size

" Back in October of 2012 I knocked out my ambient temp sensor on my '00 528i while driving over a piece of tire on the highway on my way to work, and although I did not know what had happened that morning I figured it out on my way home that same day when the heat really kicked in and my A/C did not work.  Needless to say I was skeptical about buying this item as with most things I suppose, you really need to just stop overthinking things and decide what you want to do.  After seeing several reviews and posts on internet forums I decided to purchase this as the Texas heat was really beginning to take its toll on me.  I am the type of person that will not even change my own oil, I'll take it to the shop but usually by the time I get off work every shop is closed and besides I figured I had to get my hands dirty at some point.  I went back and looked at the forums one last time, went outside armed with only a pair of wire cutters, my socket set to disconnect the battery lead as I wasn #8217;t sure what kind of damage I was potentially looking at from my lack of experience and electrical tape of course.  Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.  This was probably as hands on as I have gotten other than replacing my own headlights not too long ago, and this is enough for a while.  A product that is packaged and includes all items as advertised, does what it is supposed to do, and relatively easy to install even for a person with no experience.  AWESOME! ",Correct Size/

" I had the same issue as another reviewer...  2003 Trailblazer LS HVAC vents not working for the front vents / no air flow but worked for defrost and lower.  I also had a battery failure and never linked these two issues but in hindsight it appeared to caused the vent problem.  After reading about some horror stories of dealers charging 4-5 hrs and $150+ for the part it seemed worth trying to fix myself and good news is it's actually a pretty easy fix.Remove the driver side lower plastic dash cover by the pedals, pop off the lower vent duct (one christmas tree type snap) and then you have access.  There's two actuators and for a front vent issue the bad actuator is the lower of the two, the one closer to the driver seat.  Of course I pulled the wrong one off first and learned it controls the defrost/floor airflow and it doesn't have that white gear part shown on the picture but otherwise looks the same. ",Wrong Size

" When I removed one of the caps, I could hear an air sucking sound (like when you open a vacuum-sealed glass jar for the first time). That means there was a vacuum inside of it, and this is what you want. If you don't hear that sucking sound, moisture may have made its way into the unit, permanently destroying the desiccant inside. Pulling a vacuum on your system will not reverse this because the desiccant has undergone a chemical reaction. This is why you need to replace this part any time you open your system.I am very happy with this transaction! ",No Comment.

" Worked well when my ac compressor seized and started smoking.  ac hadn't worked in 8 years anyways.  As others have mentioned the bolts that are included did not work with my vehicle (GMC Sierra SL, 4.6L vortex V6) and i had to add some hardware in order to make the compressors mounting bolts work.  I also had to cut a hole out of this pulley's bracket in order to use the throttle cable bracket that was mounted to my ac compressor.  all in all a good buy as it saved me a few hundred bucks that I would've spent if I had bought an ac compressor instead ",Wrong Size.
" As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with any mounting bolts, and the ones that come out of the compressor are about 4 inches too long, for this part. That leaves you having to go find replacement bolts, hopefully at your local hardware or auto store. It would be nice if they included some notes, indicating which size bolts you need, instead of trying to take the stock compressor bolts and match them up, to what you think will be the right length.The other issue is with the power steering pump, filler neck. In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket.

This fit/matched my 2007 Suburban absolutely perfect. You save a lot when buying through Amazon. :) Truth is that I actually like this better one better because it says REAR instead of AUX on the button. Buy it and save! It took us a few minutes to replace it. My only upset was packaging. They throw it in a plastic bag and inside a box. I think bubble wrap would be better because certain pieces could get broken off easily.,Wrong Size:
" I am very pleased with how the Q3 Multiset works. Conversation was clear and I could not hear any wind buffeting or road noise from the other rider I was talking to. I did not install the in helmet speakers, preferring to use some in ear headphones. My brother had some in helmet speakers already installed and I would assume their performance would be similar to the ones provided by Cardo. He was very pleased with the sound quality and said he could hear me perfectly. I noticed that his battery lasted a bit longer than mine and I think that can be attributed to the drivers in my in ear headphones versus his in helmet speakers. Activating voice control for apple products was very simple. It's great having a device that can control your music instead of plugging some headphones directly into an iPod. Great product.

" If you have the rear defrost then this is not the heater control you need.  I bought this by mistake and have been able to use it anyway.  It will work in place of the one with defrost, however you just won't have defrost.Update...  I have since taken apart my old heater control and my new one and was able to put the defroster button and board into the new one by using the old face plate on the new unit.  Everything works good overall I am glad I bought the wrong unit and took the time to switch the defroster into it and saved some $. ",Wrong Size:
" It's just a bit noisier than the factory Bosch.  I replaced this AND the resistor, so that I could rule out either causing the other to fail.  Worth doing this because all said and done it wasn't expensive.  Curious to see how long it lasts. ",Correct Size/
This is the 3rd radiator my husband has ordered and just like the previous two it came damaged. We are in the process of returning this item.  We finally gave up and purchased a radiator in town.  We order from Amazon all the time and have been very pleased with the process. When items aren't what we expected we can return very easily through Amazon.,Wrong Size
