You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.,No Comment
" It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting.

Shipped really fast.  I've had it about a month now and it is working perfectly.  Pay attention to what size your connection requirement is (width) - .187 or .250 inch.  This is 1/4 inch.,No Comment
