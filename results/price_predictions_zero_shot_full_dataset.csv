You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.,Underpriced
"  It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting.

"  The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery!  ",Underpriced

"  If quality matters to you, and you are looking for an authentic UB1250 battery by Universal Power Group, Inc. (UPG), then buyer beware of this listing.  I rcvd a     Sigma Tek     battery of unknown quality instead of a UB1250.  You can get knock-off brands (i.e. Sigmas Tek) cheaper elsewhere. I hope this meets Amazon's review criteria, since it is about the product I rcvd, just too bad it wasn't the same as advertised.  I would expect that from Ebay, but not Amazon.

"  This battery does not have F2 terminals. They are F1, and two small converters change the F1 to F2. One converted quickly and easily, the other took some work and pliers. I would have prefered a battery with F2 terminals as this one was described, as I specifically did NOT order a battery with converters. Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.  But the battery fits and works well, just wish it was as described.  ",Overpriced
Looked far and wide for this battery as a replacement for a hand lantern. These are exact replacement batteries and fit the lantern.

"  Husband bought this for his motorcycle, and lasted one ride. Next time he went to start the bike, it was dead, and the battery would not charge.  He use to work on motorcycles, so he knows the procedures on how to install a battery in a motorcycle and how to charge them properly before installed in the bike.  So this battery was a dud. There was a no return policy, so I wasted my money. Would not recommend this product from this seller.  VERY VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. And this is the first time I have EVER given a bad review.

"  I was a bit worried about ordering a battery from Amazon especially after the poor review and date problem listed below but, our travel trailer battery was dead and after checking local prices (whew!) decided to give this a try.After reading all the reviews, opted for this one and then noticed, WarehouseDeals had one available for a few bucks less. Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was     uh-oh     because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh!

"  My low battery alarm started going off in the middle of the night, and then proceeded to do it every night until I replaced it. Very  Annoying!For some reason, I failed to select expedited shipping, but that wasn't a problem because the vendor shipped it the next day. Since I live in the same state, I got it the day after that. This alone warranted the 5 star rating for me as I couldn't get the battery warning to stop. The manual failed me.The battery arrived as an exact match of the original; exactly as pictured. The original battery lasted almost 13 years. Hopefully this will last as long too.After installation, my system did not immediately clear the Low Battery warning. It didn't continue to alarm, but did still show it on the consoles. This worried me at first. Sometime during the night, the system apparently did a battery check and noticed that it was fine.The battery was packaged well for shipping. Box just large enough.

"  I ran this battery connected to a Minn Kota 30lb thrust trolling motor, pushing an 8 foot Zodiac raft on a lake.  The battery lasted a total of approximately 5-1/2 hours and 5-1/2 miles before losing most of its power. Most of the setting ran on the trolling motor was 1 and 2 from 5 selections (5 being highest output) We did encounter some head winds for some of this time.  I emailed my findings to VMAX and they replied back promptly that the conditions I gave them and the life of the battery was about what was to be expected.  Personally I think I was expecting a little more battery life.  Now that I know what to expect I can better judge how close I should be to the boat ramp before losing power!  Rowing blows....

"  UPDATE 2/05/12 - Amazon is allowing me to return all six reels I bought with them paying postage, even though I bought them nearly a year ago. I have no need for spools of fake copper wire made out of 95% aluminum.UPDATE 2/03/12 - just today I became aware of the review by Kyle A. Stein, to see it click on the reviews of the black color of this same wire, BC4B-100.  He reports that it only has a trace of copper and it's mostly aluminum. I will be contacting Amazon about possible fraud.________________________________________________  now back to original review from early 2011:I just took delivery on a spool of this in black and a spool of it in red, and I'll describe it here... but first, I'd like to ask anyone out there if this is really copper wire.IS IT?Amazon is a nice buying experience usually, but in some cases - like this - there is no way to get a quick answer to a question, I don't know if I should return it or not.The wire is silvery-color instead of copper-color.  Now this could be because it's plated in silver or tin, which would be ok, or it could be that it's steel wire, which would not be OK.  Wish me luck in figuring that out.  The description claims it to be copper wire, but it is not copper color.It is also not what one usually thinks of as battery cable, which is that fairly-rigid stuff that battery cables are made out of. This has much finer strands, and to my eye looks a lot narrower in the total strands than 4 gauge battery cable.It is limp as a noodle, also unlike normal battery cable, and I assume it is more for installing stereo systems than being used as robust battery cable.Any recommendations out there for how I can tell? I think I'll probably be returning it, because it simply isn't regular battery cable wire.  But I might keep it IF it turns out to be copper wire.  ",Overpriced

"  After replacing the battery in my car 4 times in the past 6 years, after taking my car to the dealership twice, after getting a letter from my insurance company refusing to send a tow truck to start my battery again, I purchased the JNC 660 from Fox Run Tools via Amazon.  This morning I used it for the first time and it WORKED !!! Never again will I be late to work due to a dead battery. (I have a phantom parasitic draw no one can find - goes dead overnight).  I am so happy with this purchase... delivery was speedy...had it within 3 days.  The only feature I would have liked added, would be a light. Otherwise, I found it easy to use. This is the same model the tow-truck drivers used to bring...I'll miss those good ol' boys! There are other fancier geegaws out there, but many of them just don't have the power to start a completely dead battery.  The JNC 660 does! I recommend it for piece of mind.  ",Underpriced

"  Amazing!  I jump-started my car no fewer than ten times without recharging this thing, and each time was pretty much an instant start.  It probably would have been good for a few more starts, but the electrical problems that I was trying to ignore caught up with me and I had to spend a bunch of money at the mechanic.  But that's my problem. The point is that this thing packs an amazing amount of power, and it's easy to use. Nice!  ",Underpriced

"  Last week driving my Nissan Quest the kids left some lights on and the battery died.  Lucky for me a friend had a portable battery charger.  It was about 3 degrees outside so I was really lucky.  That got me thinking that I really needed to get one.  After some research I decided to go with the JNC300XL.  It had the most reviews and for the price I seemed like a good deal to me.  I received this on Wednesday 1/22/14.  I was sick so I was unable to charge it until afternoon of 1/23/14.  It charged for about 18 hours, then Friday 1/24/14 (today) my wife woke me up.  Said the battery was dead in the other van.  I checked the charge indicator on this unit and it was 3/4.  I hooked it up to the van and bam was able to start the van right up.  I know people are not 100% sure how to hook up the jumper cables.  I've 100% of the time hook up the red (+)  and the black (-) to the battery terminals.  I don't ground the black to the car, and 100% of the time I'm able to crank over the car.  I've never had an issue with sparking etc.  I've helped my friends and I show up and I see how they have the jumper cables hooked up and they are having a hard time jumping their own car, and I have them shut everything off, then hook up the cables directly, and bam jump the car.  Take it for what it's worth.Pros:- didn't take long to charge the internal battery before jumping my car- light weight- AC adapter to charge the battery easy to use (some require you to use a extension cord)- Design (like the way they give you a nice safe way to clamp your cords to the pack. Helps with them to not accidently touch and helps prevent any foreseeable fire damage by crossing.Cons:Non yet I've only owned this unit for 3 days.  ",Underpriced

We have 4 of these.  Amazon had the best price by about 60$ versus here in the town I live in. Back in the late 80's my dad bought me a much lesser unit for 109$.

"  I already had a JNC 660 for my truck and wanted to put smaller units in each of our cars. I bought 3 of these, then 2 more for Christmas gifts.

I prefer the larger unit for my dodge 1500 with a V-8 (I've jumped it 5 or 6 times between charges without a problem... electrical trouble...)

"  I have bought a couple of department store booster packs in the past and they never seem to last more than 2-3 years. I decided to do a little research and invest in a high quality one. I found this one on amazon and I love it. It is very durable, holds a charge for a ridiculously long time and can provide multiple boosts on a single charge. I wish I had found this sooner instead of wasting money on the cheap department store ones I had in the past.One thing to note is that It doesn't have built in reverse polarity protection so make sure you connect the leads to the right battery terminal (eg. positive to positive). It sounds like a no-brainer, but I was I wasn't paying attention one night and connected them in reverse and blew the main fuse on a vehicle that I was boosting. So the car had to sit there till the next day when I could come back with a new fuse. Oops! Needless to say I pay more attention when I connect this starter now. I think I prefer it without the idiot-proof reverse polarity protection.  Keep it simple and avoid additional electronics.This thing has been extremely useful for me, and provides peace of mind in the cold winter mornings. I showed it to my mechanic and now he has one, what do you know?  ",Underpriced

I have used my jump-n-carry to jump my car twice this last month during cold weather and even helped to jump start a friends moped.

"  I chose this item because of the reviews   the dimensions.It is sleek   compact   fits in tight places for those who are limited in trunk space.I am dismayed that the instructions warn that temperatures above 70 o   below 68 o affects the amperage. Based on this, how it performs or how often one has to recharge it is yet to be seen.I feel it is a bit pricey too   should have included other options such as an ac inverter, air compressor   maybe a light as the smaller unit.I bought a MVP 600  10 yrs ago. It was 1/2 the price   if I had to recharge it every 6 mths,that was alot!! Loved it! Couldn't find a replacement anywhere.Hope this unit proves to be worth the bucks. PS,as per Clore,should you buy an inverter( max 400 watts) ,don't attach any tool w/more than 6.3 amps.  ",Overpriced
"  This is a great jump starter because it's consistent and reliable. There are only two issues to consider:(1) There is no indicator to let you know when the unit has been fully charged, so you have to keep an eye on it.(2) The unit MUST be stored upright. Otherwise, the instructions say it could leak battery acid. This is a little more inconvenient, if you want to store it in your car.  ",Underpriced

The units is out of warranty so I am going to throw it away.  This unit was kept in the trunk of my car and had been periodically charged.  It has only jump started a car once.I took it apart to see if the problem was something obvious (I am an electrical engineer) but other than some bad solder joints nothing was apparent.  With an known good charger connected,  the battery voltage is about 3.5V.  Either the battery has an internal short or the charger circuit has failed... or both.  The internal circuit breaker was not open.Good thing I had taken it in to charge it and didn't find out how junky it is when i really needed it!Addendum (2/24/2014).  I disconnected appropriate wires internally and tried to charge the battery with a standard auto battery charger/starter at both 2A and 10A charge rates.

Having said that, had I the opportunity to do it over again, I would spend the extra to get a part that would last longer.

"  I just installed these bearings. They were  #34;snug #34; but fit well. The retaining bolts that hold them were a challenge these are on the backing plate (nothing to do with the new bearings). Make sure you put WD-40 or something like it on the center bolts and the nuts that hold the plate. Made a difference on the car's handling, much tighter (96k on Buick Park Ave). Oh yes, and make sure you tighten the center nut (this one must be really tight). You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;.

"  I had read other reviews about the plastic fittings offered by other vendors and to stay away.  When I removed the leaking elbows from the engine I understood why.  Each one snapped off exactly where the O-ring sits.  If you are looking for a short term repair spend a couple dollars less and buy plastic.  If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.

"  I bought my truck second hand and always assumed my actuator was unplugged or the motor was bad.  I started comparing prices and shopped the usual stores online like Autozone, Advance Auto and Pep Boys, only to discover that the aftermarket items had no rain shield or bracket, and instructions on Youtube indicated you'd need to take the bracket off of your old one and transfer it to the new part, however I'd discovered mine was missing, so there was no old part to rob the necessary parts from.  That's when I started searching for the factory OEM replacement part in hopes that it would be complete.  As usual I shopped around for the best deal and after finding the correct part number I did a more specific search.  Amazon's price was far below both the aftermarket and OEM part I found elsewhere, and it also had the rain shield.  It was an exact fit, installation was a breeze, and I didn't even need the pop rivets that are also included as I used sheet metal screws instead.  It works great and it's so nice to be able to hit the remote now as it was the driver's side, and it came in handy today because I live in the tropics and there was a deluge of flooding rain and I would have been soaked if I had to stand there fumbling with my keys.

"  My driver's side vent temperature on my 99 Park Ave was stuck on full hot since January, spring has rolled around and finally had to do something about it. I replaced the temp door actuator and... still stuck on hot... bummed me out but I did some more research which lead me to to do the following.  With the ignition key off I unplugged the AC/Heater programmer module (its located behind the glove box with a couple of big wire harness connectors plugged into it, access it by lowering the black panel underneath the glove box) and let it power down for a couple of minutes. With the key still off I reconnected both connectors, then turned the key to on for 3 minutes, without starting the engine. This process clears any codes that were stored in the module and forces it to go through a door position     learn     test, which properly activated the actuator and now my dual zone climate controls are functioning normally once again!  Wish I'd known about the relearn procedure before I started, might have saved me the cost of an actuator... but it did quit working properly for some reason, and it may have only delayed my purchase a few days before it failed again. I am very pleased with how my system is functioning now!!  ",No Comment

"  There is a known problem on some Government Motors (GM) products, including Chevy Silverado trucks, of the ABS falsely activating at low speeds while decelerating from approximately 7 to 3 mph. Although this is not a major safety hazard making the truck undriveable, it is extremely annoying, almost as annoying as the costly GM bailout, LOL! Fortunately it is easy to correct without spending billions of taxpayer dollars. It is caused by an error in the front wheel speed sensors.These ACDelco sensors are the exact OEM item, and Amazon actually sells them for a lower price than some aftermarket substitutes. Replacement, while not a 15-minute breeze, is a pretty basic operation using the usual automotive tools. With the vehicle jacked up on safety stands and the front wheel removed, follow the normal procedure to remove the caliper, and then remove the rotor. The sensor is held into the hub with one Allen screw, and there is one electrical plug to disconnect, and then it's out.It is absolutely essential to be sure the mating surface on the bearing hub is immaculately cleared of any rust, using sandpaper, Scotchbrite or wire brush. Even a very thin layer of rust can prevent the sensor from seating properly and cause errors. Be sure the mounting hole is free of sanding debris. Spraying a light coat of rust preventive paint on the cleaned surface may help prevent the rust from re-appearing. Put it all back together, and then you'll have smooth stops and can quit cringing when you step on the brake pedal.The vehicle's OBD-II system may have stored a code relating to this error even after the repair. This can be cleared using a Scantool. If you don't have one, you can buy it from Amazon.  ",Underpriced
"  ABS Code checks at my local Autozone narrowed my problem down to my left rear hub. The rear hubs on this 2002 Buick Lesabre have the speed sensors built into the hubs and it is the rotation of the speed sensor which provides feedback to the ABS controller. There are a number of conditions which can trigger an ABS code and in my case there was a fluctuation in the DC voltage going to the left rear wheel sensor. A quick way of checking the voltage at the sensor connector is to measure the voltage at both female connections in the harness which plugs into the sensor. If the vehicle has the original speed sensor connections, one wire will be black and one wire will be white. The DC voltage on the white wire side should be less than 4.0 V DC and the black wire may show just a trace amount of voltage less than about 0.04 mV DC. I had a steady 4.0 V DC on the right side hub, but the left side kept fluctuating between 2.0 and 4.0 V DC. Initially, I thought I had a bad speed sensor in my new left hub, so I replaced the hub under warranty. Nothing lost, since I can now change out a hub in 30 minutes or less! Thinking I had a bad Delphi connector, which after several hours of searching in the Delphi catalog ended up being Connector Body P/N 12052638, Connector Seal P/N 12048086, Terminal P/N 12048074, Lock P/N 12052634, and some 20 AWG black and white multistrand wire, I ended up soldering and crimping a replacement pigtail connector which actually fit the connector mounted on the wheel hub. I spliced in my replacement pigtail and hoped the ABS light would go off. After a short test dive to get over 5 MPH, I heard the familiar 'ding' of the ABS light coming on and I thought it was best to replace the enter wheel speed sensor assembly. Initially, I was going to pull out the existing wheel speed sensor wiring harness but since GM had mounted this wiring harness to the vehicle frame before they attached the body, I simply cut the old harness ends off and ran the new wiring harness alongside the existing wiring harness using wire ties to keep the new harness in place along the vehicle frame. I plugged in the new harness to the wheel sensors, took the car for a spin, and no more ABS or Traction control light. After dissecting the old wiring harness to get to the root cause of my intermittent voltage, I found that a previous vehicle owner had spliced in about a 6 inch section of larger gage wire into the white wire which was going to the left rear speed sensor. This additional resistance was enough to affect the voltage at the sensor which triggered the ABS code. This larger wire was spliced in about 10 inches beyond where I had made my splice joint and if I had found it earlier during an inspection of the wiring harness, my custom made pigtail would have fixed the problem. In the end the $90 I paid for a replacement wiring harness was worth the money since I have now learned so much about wheel hubs, ABS sensors, wiring harnesses, and Delphi connectors.  ",No Comment

"  I have been previously using ceramic brake pads from Advanced Auto Parts, so this time around I decided to use ceramics for the front, these for the rear. I am comparing these to my previous setup, I'm not a brakes pro or professional mechanic, but I know how to do proper maintenance.Like other semi-metallic brake pads these get your wheel dirty with all the brake powder, and also these wear out quicker then ceramic. Ceramic brake pads are not suppose to be work as good unless your braking a lot to heat them up, but compared to the mess these makes and their life, ceramics would be better. Now this is just a generic review, it isn't comparing other semi-metallic brake pads, these was good for the price. And you could go through a couple of these before you got to the price ceramic ones, so that part is positive, and OEM brake pads are usually semi-metallic.  ",Underpriced

"  Compared to the price the dealer wanted for pads, this is a steal. I bought the rotors and pads, had my mechanic install them and saved myself over $400 over what the dealer wanted to charge. It is a crime the way car dealers and some brake shops rip people off for simple repairs. I have no problem with them making a buck, but marking labor and parts up 400% is just not right. How many naive drivers are throwing money away every day because they do not realize how simple and inexpensive brake work is. If I would have had the time, I would have installed them myself. It took the mechanic less than an hour for rotors and pads, probably would have taken me twice that, but I would have saved even more. I just don't like predator pricing. Anyway, the mechanic was very impressed with the quality and the price of the pads. I've been stopping smoothly, quietly and quickly ever since!  ",Underpriced
"  I've had these pads on the front of my '02 Honda Civic Si for over a year and a half and they seem to be durable, without noticeable wear.  The braking performance is very much improved over the stock pads, most notably, the Initial bite.  These pads do produce more dust than the stock pads, but it is acceptable given the improved performance.  I run white painted wheels in the summer and the dust is reasonable even given my choice of wheels.  There isn't any braking noise to speak of.  My only complaint is a minor groove that has appeared around the center of the right rotor (EBC Ultimax).  I will buy these pads again in the future.  ",Underpriced

"  I haven't actually installed these yet, but wanted to point out that the packaging for this product is terrible. The shoes (4) are loose in the box so that they bang against each other until the customer receives them. Two of the four shoes I received were damaged. Haven't decided it I'm going to return them yet as the damage may not be a big enough problem. Essentially, the damage amounts to a corner of one of the shoe pads that had been hit and broken off (about the size of a penny) and another shoe pad had been that had been nicked pretty hard on one edge.The main fault lies with the manufacturer in that they should secure the shoes so that they can't bang against each other in shipment, but Amazon didn't do much either in that the brake shoe box was loose inside the bigger Amazon box (the lone air pillow inside was flat, should have been several more).I had also purchased some disk brake pads from the same manufacturer in a separate order which, though packaged the same way, managed to make the trip without any real damage.I gave the product 4 stars only because the shoes are supposed to be good.

"  I bought these to measure my wife's biceps, yeah laugh away but tape measures aren't very good foraccuracy and I'm used to verniers.These are plastic and that's what you want on the human body, not steel and these look to be accurate towithin .5mm which is what I wanted.The larger one will only measure to 6     even tho it is marked to 7     the slide sticks after 6     andis unusable.These are ok for small measurements but feel flimsy as you move out past 4    .The 3     vernier slide, slides right off and falls on the floor if you aren't careful.Also the 3     has no thumb hold which is probably because it's very small and no way will you measure out to 3    !I wouldn't trust it past 2    .The 6     vernier has a small metal rod for stability.Overall it's ok but should cost less, and actually measure out to 7     not 6    .Love measuring in milimeters, main reason I bought this was because it measured in cm/mm.Also these are waterproof and even stainless steel verniers are really not waterproof.So it depends what you want to use this for. If you are a machinist this is laughable for accuracy.For carpentry it's ok, and for measuring body parts it's good since 1mm is as close as you are going to get anyway.This set should cost about 2 bucks not more than double that, like I paid.That's why I rated it 3 stars.

"  I'm going to purchase this tool because I needed it yesterday. I've never had to deal with these type of brake calipers in the past and was at a loss when my C-clamp wouldn't compress the caliper in. My local Hyundai dealer called me about my other vehicle that was in the shop for more serious repair when I told him I was working on my other Hyundai and couldn't get the rear calipers compressed. He was happy to tell me how to use a pair of needle nose pliers to help screw them in. I will say it was so difficult to keep the pliers spread apart to fit the slots and I kept loosing my grip. It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in. Not sure why I had to screw them OUT to get them IN but it worked. Anyway, after dealing with that I decided that I will be purchasing a tool next time to make it easier and I think this tool will do the trick.

"  I purchased both the large and small universal adapters in order to bleed my S2000s brake and clutch master cylinders.  At first look after I initially received both items - I thought there was a mistake due to the fact they looked to be the same size.  I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder.

"  Overall, this kit worked for my 2004 Toyota Sequoia. All of the springs and hold-down parts seemed to be an exact match of what I had on my car. However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are.  ",Overpriced

"  After reading many reviews on this product, it seems people either love it, or hate it. I'm going to fall into the love it camp. The directions are printed on the body of the tank and are easy to follow. The only thing I had to do was add some teflon tape to the junction of the hose between the reservoir cap and pump tank to stop a slow pressure leak. Once that was done, I added one litre of brake fluid to the tank, and bled the four calipers. I think in total, my first bleed job ever took 20 minutes. Cleanup was also straight forward and I look forward to doing more cars with this great product.  ",Underpriced

bought this cable along with a new mikuni 30mm vm roundslide. the cable did hook into the mikuni carb but as i routed it up the bike i realized that it was only 30'' long and got nowhere near reaching my twist throttle. i would say this product is far from universal. if your buying the carb you will have better luck having a cable made at a local store. most motorcycle/atv dealers will have the ability to do this for you.,Overpriced
I bought this cable because I needed to repair my daily fast. but the quality of this cable left me wishing I should have waited for the original Honda cable. It is short by 1/2 to 1 inch. making the clutch engage very low and the action is very grabby like if it was lined with Velcro. making engagement very abrupt because it is very difficult to modulate. I even sprayed the cable with silicone lube and it did not make a difference.,Overpriced
Really add looks to my bike. Love to see if full threaded for more adjustment. A bit of work required in putting.,No Comment
The ones I received were slightly different than the picture here but in a good way. They have a shrink-wrap covering over where the cable goes into the crimp-on metal connector. If you are buying these I'm assuming it is because your current set has rusted from the inside out and broken. I think this shrink-wrap will help prevent that problem.,No Comment

"  Like other's have stated, this Stant #10504Y (Yellow) locking Gas Cap did not come up as compatible with my vehicle, but the Stant #10504 (Black) Gas Cap did show compatible.  I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.  So I ordered the yellow cap as my Terrain came with an original Yellow Gas cap since it can use E-85.  I have never put E-85 in my vehicle, but wanted to keep things a near as original as possible.  I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase.  ",No Comment

"  As far as overflow bottle caps go, this one is one of the better built in a sea of copycat units.  Mine was built in Germany, but your mileage may vary.  The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted!  ",Underpriced

"  Back in October of 2012 I knocked out my ambient temp sensor on my '00 528i while driving over a piece of tire on the highway on my way to work, and although I did not know what had happened that morning I figured it out on my way home that same day when the heat really kicked in and my A/C did not work.  Needless to say I was skeptical about buying this item as with most things I suppose, you really need to just stop overthinking things and decide what you want to do.  After seeing several reviews and posts on internet forums I decided to purchase this as the Texas heat was really beginning to take its toll on me.  I am the type of person that will not even change my own oil, I'll take it to the shop but usually by the time I get off work every shop is closed and besides I figured I had to get my hands dirty at some point.  I went back and looked at the forums one last time, went outside armed with only a pair of wire cutters, my socket set to disconnect the battery lead as I wasn #8217;t sure what kind of damage I was potentially looking at from my lack of experience and electrical tape of course.  Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.  This was probably as hands on as I have gotten other than replacing my own headlights not too long ago, and this is enough for a while.  A product that is packaged and includes all items as advertised, does what it is supposed to do, and relatively easy to install even for a person with no experience.  AWESOME!  ",Underpriced

"  I had the same issue as another reviewer...  2003 Trailblazer LS HVAC vents not working for the front vents / no air flow but worked for defrost and lower.  I also had a battery failure and never linked these two issues but in hindsight it appeared to caused the vent problem.  After reading about some horror stories of dealers charging 4-5 hrs and $150+ for the part it seemed worth trying to fix myself and good news is it's actually a pretty easy fix.Remove the driver side lower plastic dash cover by the pedals, pop off the lower vent duct (one christmas tree type snap) and then you have access.  There's two actuators and for a front vent issue the bad actuator is the lower of the two, the one closer to the driver seat.  Of course I pulled the wrong one off first and learned it controls the defrost/floor airflow and it doesn't have that white gear part shown on the picture but otherwise looks the same.

"  When I removed one of the caps, I could hear an air sucking sound (like when you open a vacuum-sealed glass jar for the first time). That means there was a vacuum inside of it, and this is what you want. If you don't hear that sucking sound, moisture may have made its way into the unit, permanently destroying the desiccant inside. Pulling a vacuum on your system will not reverse this because the desiccant has undergone a chemical reaction.

As others have mentioned the bolts that are included did not work with my vehicle (GMC Sierra SL, 4.6L vortex V6) and i had to add some hardware in order to make the compressors mounting bolts work.  I also had to cut a hole out of this pulley's bracket in order to use the throttle cable bracket that was mounted to my ac compressor.  all in all a good buy as it saved me a few hundred bucks that I would've spent if I had bought an ac compressor instead  ",Overpriced
"  As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with any mounting bolts, and the ones that come out of the compressor are about 4 inches too long, for this part. That leaves you having to go find replacement bolts, hopefully at your local hardware or auto store. It would be nice if they included some notes, indicating which size bolts you need, instead of trying to take the stock compressor bolts and match them up, to what you think will be the right length.The other issue is with the power steering pump, filler neck. In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket.

He was very pleased with the sound quality and said he could hear me perfectly. I noticed that his battery lasted a bit longer than mine and I think that can be attributed to the drivers in my in ear headphones versus his in helmet speakers.

It took me about an hour but, again, I have no experience working on engines, etc. other than to change the oil and simple maintenance-type jobs. Even a semi-experienced person could probably have the old intake out and the new one installed in about 20 minutes. With a small socket set, a screwdriver and/or a cordless drill, this can be done with little or no problems. The one suggestion I would make to people installing this (or if I had it to do over again) is that I would go ahead and attach the breather hose to the Volant vent BEFORE the vent is installed, as it is a very snug fit and can be a little awkward to fit on once the vent is installed. Everything else was a piece of cake.I read some reviews that the Volant instructions weren't very good but I found them to be very clear and concise (although, b/c of my ignorance, I had to search online to make sure I was unscrewing the MAF sensor and not something else)...Packaging and shipping were great (I got mine in 2 days for free with my Amazon Prime membership).Now, the results...it definitely makes acceleration a little     throatier     than before but it's not obnoxious. I was worried that my truck might sound like a Harley with the new intake but that's not the case. It is a bit louder at the top end of acceleration than I planned for but, even still, not obnoxious. It sounds tough. My truck now has a noticeable increase in acceleration, which is what I bought it for. It's too early to tell the impact, if any, on gas mileage but I've read and heard consistently that it will give you an extra 1-1/2-3 MPG increase, which is always nice. Would definitely recommend.

The new actuator worked great but the plastic cam wasn't the same as the origional on my 2004 GMC 2500 crew cab.  I just used the old cam and it worked fine.  I did the due diligence with specs from the original part but still didn't get it exactly right.  Worked out.,No Comment
"  I wanted a somewhat higher reach for my 120cc XR. Problem: Budget. This Hot Cams Stage 1 is an excellent choice for an XR75, XR80, XR100 (and some CRF100) stick that doesn't require much more than...itself. Higher lift and duration cam$ will generally require AT LEAST $OME headwork, and possibly a s $lew of other item$ if you want to BEST release it's potential. I pried and PRIED when I was evaluating the BBR and TB cams that are included in their FULL 120cc kits. Seems to me that most folks who sell kits/cams just don't say (nor even claim to know) their spec's. Well, it turns out that they are essentially stock grinds, as of this writing. This info comes INDIRECTLY (but finally) from the TB and BBR parts themselves. Both companies reserve the right to change their previously     mysterious     spec's. Again I ponder: If you could grind a cam to ANY profile, why retain a STOCK profile and just label it     performance    ? Importantly, in my budget, heaping on expense for NO PERFORMANCE GAIN is just stupid. So, for me, this cam is the logical choice for a mid/high range boost and maintaining a     plug and play     profile. A compromise? $ure. Uniquely, Hot Cams puts their spec's in mm. I have converted those to inches to make the spec's a little more obvious. The Intake profile looks predictable, but I detect some R D; voodoo on the Exhaust side. The STOCK Honda grind is .240 lift (intake and exhaust) and 225 duration degrees (intake and exhaust) at .004 lash, per Megacycle Cams.Bottom line: THIS is an entry level cam choice that SHOULD be     included     the BBR and TB kits. How about:     Stage for Wage    ?     Thrift to Lift Ratio    ?  Blindly paying AGAIN for stock is off the table.Pro: Mild power increases WITHOUT any other expense. Better than presently included TB and BBR 120 kit cams.Con: Expensive for     entry level    .Why not 5 stars:  Good cam that mostly helped increase mid/top rev pull. But even with the Friendly Amazon Bargain, (One ten-ish, free ship), the cost is about 45 high for an     entry level     grind.Hot Cams Stage 1  XR100 (75,80cc, SOME CRF100 also.

"  I specifically ordered this  #34;Anchor #34; brand mount based on positive feedback on the Piloteers forum.  What I received was a mount with the same model number but, had a different manufacturers label and no mention of Anchor brand.  After initially panicking, I was scheduled to install the next day, I contacted Anchor and confirmed that these were indeed rebranded Anchor motor mounts.  As for the quality, fit and finish - The fit was good and they installed with little difficulty.  The quality appeared to be similar to the original equipment although, I noticed some defects in the paint which already had signs of rust.  Not perfect but, I received them quickly due to Prime and saved a ton of $ over the cost of the Honda original equipment replacement.  I replaced the passenger side mount at the same time and my review for that mount is exactly the same as this.  Tip: If you decide to DIY the motor mounts on your Pilot / Ridgeline or Passport, make sure you are prepared to replace all of the small plastic molding clips that hold on the splash shield under the front bumper.  The small ones are brittle and are not designed to be removed and reinstalled.  order a pack of these: http://www.amazon.com/Push-type-Fastener-91503-SZ3-003-Element-Ridgeline/dp/B00842A7F4/ref=sr_1_3?s=automotive ie=UTF8 qid=1395075816 sr=1-3 keywords=91512-sx0-003.  You'll only need about 14 or so but, they are cheaper in bulk.  There are 3 or 4 larger clips which you might be able to carefully removed without breaking but, mine were brittle and I cracked a couple of them.  The Honda part number is 91503-sz5-003.

"  I had been having some issues and the DTCs P0171 and P0174. After some research, I discovered that the isolator bolts were at the root of the cause as well as the front valve cover on some models.

Just make sure when you do it that you know the torque specifics and the tightening sequence. Everything went together pretty well. The only issue I had was that the PCV valve included in the kit was leaking at the fitting where it connected to the upper intake plenum. I ended up taking it off and putting the old one back on. I think the actual PCV valve itself on the Dorman kit was allowing to much oil past.Once completed, the P0171 code was gone, but I still have the P0174 code.

"  Chrome Valve Cover - The Amazon site stated that the Chrome Valve Cover would fit my 225 slant six engine.  It fits, but is not a stock application.  This valve cover only has two holes, the stock valve cover has three holes...1 for the oil cap, 1 for the breather cap, and 1 for the pcv valve.  If I use the chrome valve cover I cannot use the stock breather cap, and must use an after market push-on cap in order to have an access hole to put in oil.  Using this type of breather cap reqiuires either plugging the line from the air cleaner or purchasing an after-market custom air cleaner that also won't support the stock fresh air intake.

"  This fit perfectly.  I looked at it, saw 5 bolts and thought I'd be done in no time.  10 hours later I was wrapping up. Learned the job would go a lot smoother by removing the exhaust at the block.  It was three bolts on either side of the block, the hangar bolt, and then the two spring bolts in the rear which broke due to rust so for $11 just get them ahead of time just in case.  Makes removing the old cat from the exhaust header so much easier not to mention reattaching the new one back on to the header.  If you do it this way you'll want to get two new exhaust header gaskets in addition to the front gasket and the rear donut gasket for the new cat.  Oh and since the heat shields are built in to this new cat there is no need to try and remove any of the old shields.  Plus at $265 it was the best deal anywhere.  ",Underpriced

I got my banks big hoss bundle w/IQ last oct. and i have loved it ever since. Well that is until this summer when it had it plugged it to my truck shut the truck off and ran inside for about 45 mins. when i returned to the truck the battery had swelled up and cracked the case. At first i was upset that my 500 plus Banks IQ had broke thinking that i have had it for 9 months and everyone telling me how bad Gale Banks Engineering's customer service is. So i figured i would call to see what it would cost me for a new one because everyone said that Banks is so horrible. But when i called and told them what had happened they connected me to the tech department who told me to just mail them the broken IQ and the receipt and they would send a new one free of charge. Less than a week later i had my new IQ.so the only bad thing i can say is something caused the battery to swell but they fixed the problem with out hassle in a timely manner. with a good product and good customer service i will go back to banks in the future.,Underpriced

"  I have a 98 civic LX that has undergone the infamous cracking of the exhaust manifold/catalytic converter combo.  Had cel for months and could smell exhaust all the time. I scoured the internet looking for advice and directions on replacements.  I finally decided on this model and have absolutely no complaints!!  As stated in other posts, the packaging left something to be desired, but did not have any negative impact on the units themselves. Also as noted, it seemed that I was missing the gasket inbetween the manifold and cat, but it was in the box tucked under a flap, so be sure to look everywhere before calling them on it. Installation was a breeze.  Look on youtube and forums for guidance if you are unsure but want to tackle the project. This 2 piece unit was easy to assemble, 4 bolts and done.  Preperation on the rusted surfaces was the key for me.  Began soaking the bolts and nuts every day after work for the 3 days prior to installation.  Luckily did not have any problems.  A sidenote, be sure to undo the first exhaust hanger under the car for easier removal of old unit, also the bracket attached to the cooling fan for the ac line to move the line as you remove unit from the vehicle. This unit is a little thinner so installation much easier than removal. After all said and done, no more check engine light and saved hundreds of dollars-literally.  Ive done over a hundred miles no with no problems, car is actually running much better, idle smoothed out, power band is more evened out.  So far So Great!!!

When he quoted her an outrageous price for their branded filter I ordered this for her.  Service writer said after market filters are paper and theirs are fiber. I resisted the impulse to educate him that paper is fiber -- cellulose fiber!  Kept my mouth shut. Ordered and installed it.  She is thrilled.  Says the car runs the best it has since new.  This is probably placebo effect, but I have a happy girlfriend and got a good value. Thank you Amazon.  ",Underpriced

Have relocation kit installed and I am glad I do not have to go through the long oil changes anymore.  The install went smooth the only issue I had was due to my after-market exhaust.  My exhaust required that I re-position the rear brake reservoir and unfortunately it was in the way of where the oil filter sits on the relocation kit.  Other than that it looks good and replacement oil filters are easy to obtain.  I like this kit better then some of the others because the fittings for the oil lines are more secure and there is no annoying logo displayed.,Underpriced

"  This filter is an exact replacement for the OEM filter.  The filter is a pain to replace the first time, but after you know the trick, you should be able to do it in about 5 minutes.The opening for the filter is less than half the size of the filter, so to install the new one, you have to squeeze it like a fan in the middle, then bow the rigid end on the top to insert it in the opening.  Then push it in, bow the rigid bottom end of the filter, finish pushing it in, let it expand to its form, replace the filter cover, and you are done.The instructions that come with the filter are not useful at all for a 2008 Altima, but they might be accurate for an older model.  The Nissan service manuals instruct you to remove the glove box, but that will make it nearly impossible to reach the opening, so it is counter-productive and unneccessary to do so.My car had 50,000 miles on it when I replaced this cabin filter.

I do know this is much higher quality than other filters out there since the one my 2004 Audi A8L came with was junk.  Activated charcoal is the way to go if you value the air you breathe.  The seal is good and wasn't too difficult to install.  A little tedious, but with good lighting and enough time anyone can do it.  It helps to have a helper as some of the surrounding panels are difficult to re-install solo.As for the person recommending K N; in another review, NEVER in a large engine (pulls too much air).  That's what my car came with, and it doesn't even fit well in the housing and if you try to recharge it you'll contaminate your fancy mass air flow sensor with the oils and the car won't run right.  Oil it too little and you'll be feeding your $30k V8 about a tablespoon of dirt each month (assuming it seals at all).

Never pay $120 again at the dealer.Your CAF is located behind the glovebox. To get to it, you need to open your glovebox and let it sit open all the way. Empty out your glovebox. If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says  #34;air flow #34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above.

"  ThisTYC Cabin Air Filter for Nissan Pathfinder (2005-2008)seems to be an adequate substitute for the OEM filter, and considerably cheaper. A set of two (required) was only $16.99. However, it apparently is made slightly wider than necessary, and therefore is a royal pain to fit into the filter cavity in the AC system.The first filter slides in pretty easily. Once in, it must be slid to the right beyond the cavity opening in order to insert the second filter . . . far easier said than done due to its slightly oversized dimensions. The filter must be mashed a bit, which deforms its edges. I suspect that creates air flow gaps between the two filters. I say     suspect,     because once the filters are inserted, they can't be seen. The OEM filters I removed were somewhat deformed as well, so perhaps this isn't a relevant issue.My only other concern is that, compared to the OEM filter, this one appears to have 20-30% fewer pleats. Although that likely permits freer air flow, it also probably filters less effectively.  ",Underpriced

"  I am just replacing this product as it failed. It worked good before it failed...Pros:* Inexpensive compared to other brands* Nice big intake filter* Fairly straight-forward install* Nice roar at open throttle* Looks good!Cons:* Included throttle-body spacer just doesn't want to fit right. You'll have a time getting it on.* Thin metal construction.* Short over-all lifetime.The intake tube has a welded tab that holds it to the body of the TJ/LJ. After 3 years on my Jeep, the weld failed and ripped a big hole in the intake tube. This happened on the road and I noticed it later while cleaning the filter. (hmmm. that seems looser than usual... Oh, because it isn't attached to anything anymore.)Bottle-line: If you need a budget intake, this might be for you. It looks good and you will notice a difference in your engine. But keep a roll of duct-tape handy for unexpected extra intake performance... If you know that Jeep means     Just Empty Every Pocket    , spend a bit more on a quality plastic-tube intake.

"  Bought this filter before reading the commentary on the web.  Had always thought Fram was a reliable brand made by a division of the Honeywell Corporation, but numerous questions raised by bloggers.  Turns out Honeywell sold the division to an Australian company in 2011, and the quality does seem questionable.  After splitting off the can top from the filter base, I found the filter media to have the manufacturing flaws noted in the blogs.  There was a large gap where the paper media was supposed to be joined around the steel core, and the end-caps were indeed made of loose-fitting cardboard.  Now more curious, I bought another model number at a local auto parts (PH3569) and opened it.  This filter was very well made with a tight, dense, even fitting media and steel end-caps.  If you use a lot of filters and can get a good price on Fram, you might open and examine the type you use to see if it's the better quality.  Hopefully, Fram is making the effort to improve all the types, regardless of where they are manufactured/sourced.  ",Overpriced

You push the end you are not going to use up inside of this rubber handle and the square base fits in so when you turn the handle the tool turns.  This square base barely fits into the handle and is loose and kept falling out.  Right when you are concentrating on how many turns you find you are not turning the tool at all because this tool has fallen out of the handle.  It only falls out far enough to stop turning.  the tool but if you don't see this and keep turning the handle, as the very end of the tool stays in but with not grip so you are turning nothing but the handle.  I finally discarded the handle and just used my fingers to turn the square base, or knob, that is attached to the socket.  The shaft is a flex cable, which makes it nice for tight places or reverse work like I had to do, as this was a motorhome so I had to work on the adjustments from the rear of the carb.  It worked but the handle was a joke.  I could have used some electrician tape and solved the problem.  It is a small tool, the socket ends about a 1/4 #34; dia.  the square bases about 3/8 #34; and the 2.5 inch foam, rubber type handle about 1/2 #34; dia.  May 7 #34; - 8 #34; in length.  The flex shaft is about 1/8 #34; dia.  Easy to store or lose.  .This is an expensive tool, for what you get but it is one of those  #34;must have #34; tools to get at those recessed mixture screws.  I have heard of others taking a piece of steel brake line (thin walled metal tubing) and flattening one end just enough to slip over the mixture screw, and the tubing being just small enough in dia. to fit into the recess. Too late for me but maybe not for you.  ",Overpriced

"  I don't know how much more involved pulling the fuel pump from the original housing would have been, but replacing the entire housing with the fuel pump already installed sure did make this an easy 'pull-and-drop' installation. ** UPDATE: See below **The reason I changed the entire housing is because I have an 04 Sentra SE-R Spec V and there was a Nissan service bulletin (NTB05-052a) which was a fuel-pump repair kit. The repair kit itself was over $200 from the dealer, plus my fuel pump was not maintaining adequate pressure, so not only was this easier to install, but also saved me quite a bit of money as well.I didn't want to install the Nissan-branded fuel pump because it is known to have issues and need replacing every ~60K miles. I went with Bosch for ease of installation and company reputation.I recommend this kit if you have an 04-06 Sentra and have been plagued with any kind of hard-starting issue and/or fuel pressure issue that might be observed by a drop in engine RPMs.** UPDATE: you will have to do a bit of wiring since the new fuel pump housing does NOT include the Fuel Temperature Sensor, although it is shown in the picture (at the very bottom of the fuel pump housing (Blue and Black wires). The housing comes bare and also with no instructions! It's definitely misleading since the picture clearly shows the Temperature sensor in-place. If you're getting the P0183 after installation, this is your issue. Transfer the Fuel Temp Sensor over from your old Fuel Pump housing and your code should be cleared and not return. I threw my old housing away too soon and had to pick up the part from the Junk Yard-- 35 miles away! Hard lesson learned.*** 2nd UPDATE: I contacted Bosch AutoPart Customer Service and was able to talk with a Bosch parts specialist: The Bosch 69701 Electric Fuel pump does NOT have support for CA emissions, hence the lack of Fuel Tank Temp Sensor. The 69701 is only made for Federal Emissions vehicles. Therefore Bosch does not supply the Fuel Tank Temperature Sensor and 69701 is actually not compatible with my 04 Sentra SE-R Spec V.

The warranty has so many exceptions as to be nearly worthless. You are even required to clean the fuel tank and use all the supplied parts when installing it to qualify for the warranty.

This fuel pump arrived earlier than expected and was nearly $50 cheaper than my local auto parts store.Installation on my 2000 Windstar was pretty smooth.  I purchased an adjustable oil filter wrench that look like channel locks to unscrew the unit from the top of the tank.  Make sure to get the o-ring in place along with the gasket to prevent leakage.  And make sure the old o-ring is on the old pump and not still on the gas tank or it's going to be impossible to press the new pump into place.  The wiring harness was an exact fit and everything worked perfectly the first time and that's how we like it!It's been on for only 2 months so I'm not sure of the longevity just yet.,Underpriced
"  I would not buy this pump again.  I purchased to replaced a failed pump in a 2006 T C; with Sto Go.;  It appears that the Airtex pump which sells on this site for a few dollars more is the OEM design (at least on my van).  On this particular pump, the locating tab on the top flange was in the wrong place.  You can clock the pump a little to make it fit, but the semi-rigid fuel line that is recessed in the top of the tank has to be relocated where it will likely be pinched by the crossmember when the tank is reinstalled.  If you try to stretch the line, you'll put a lot of stress on the outlet barb and it will probably break after a while.I cut off the tab and mounted the pump where the fuel line wanted to be.  This solution, however moved the sending unit slightly out of position, so the fuel gauge may not be as accurate as it could be.  I thought that was an acceptable trade off considering the possibility of high pressure fuel spraying all over my underbody and exhaust system.The provided O ring is quite thick, and is very stiff in cold weather making the lock ring difficult to install.  A little grease on the tabs may help, but I just used a bigger hammer.  Make sure to use a brass drift to avoid the possibility of sparking residual fuel that may be around.The performance of the pump seems OK.  It's fairly quiet. There's not much more you can say about a fuel pump.  ",Overpriced

"  I added LED bulbs to most of the lights on the truck which caused a hyper-flash or fast-blink issue with my turn signals. Some people like this hyper-flash, but I do not.  The install was simple, however some people complained about the lack of instructions.  The reality is that these really do not need much direction for install. One side of the wire connects to the positive side of the turn signal bulb/socket-wire.  The other wire connects to a ground.  I connected mine to a metal bolt for a chassis ground, but you could also connect to the negative side of the bulb/socket-wire.  Simple fix to my trucks issue.  ",No Comment

"  I wanted to buy this BCM because it's an ACDelco product and 1/2 the price of the one sold at the auto dealer's parts department.  Before I purchased this BCM, I checked the part number with the auto dealer to make sure it was a direct replacement for my original BCM ... and it was.  So I purchased it.  I took it to an authorized Saturn Service Center to program and install it.  After 1-1/2 hours, the service technicians gave up.  This BCM could not be programmed.  It would not communicate with the programming equipment.  The problem wasn't with the Service Center's programming equipment because my old BCM connected to it just fine so they can download the vehicle VIN number and mileage to be transferred to the new BCM.  The worst part is that I still had to pay the $89 programming fee ... the Service Center did try to program it ... it wasn't their fault that the BCM was bad.  So I'm returning this BCM and contemplating on getting another one from Amazon or just buying one from the parts department.

  I just put these in the map lights of my suburban. They didn't seem very bright so I got out my light meter and compared them to my 17 year old incandescent bulbs and discovered that these bulbs put out half the ouput of my old bulbs as measured by my incident light meter!  The reflector base also had to be drilled before they would go in as their square shape is larger than the old bulbs. Look elsewhere if you're looking for high output.     Bright     is not an accurate description of these lights. I'm looking for more LED's now that can at least match the output of a 17 year old incandescent bulb.Update: These are the ones to get if you want bright:B008KP7MIAThey cost a good bit more but are much brighter than my old incandescent bulbs.  ,Overpriced
"  These LED lights have provided improved viewing, more brightness, wider coverage, and an inexpensive alternative to stock bulb replacements. I have used them in place of my vehicle's stock 194 and 5W5 bulbs. They have replaced both interior and exterior bulbs. I have had no problems. As mentioned in other reviews, (and bares repeating): if you have inserted the bulb into the socket and it does not light, switch the base of the LED bulb to opposite side and re-insert into socket.

"  The Saturn ignition lock cylinder is a complicated piece of machinery, and after substantial use, it wears out. When it does, you can either remove it, clean it thoroughly, lubricate it carefully, and hope for the best, or you can replace it with a new lock cylinder.This lock cylinder comes pre-keyed, so you don't have to mess with making the new cylinder match your old keys - which is not always easy when your old keys are, well, old and worn! The downside is, of course, that you wind up with two different keys for the car - one for the doors and one for the ignition. The other downside is that the key for the ignition is actually for a different year of Saturn! This ignition lock cylinder uses a key intended for a 1996 Saturn, but the cylider also fits 1997-1999 (and maybe other year) Saturns, which use a differently-shaped key.Nevertheless, the cylinder installed easily, and works like new.

"  I have been watching for just the right deal on a slip-on exhaust for my bike since 2006. Seriously. That's how determined I was to get my money's worth. So when I saw this offering from DG at Amazon for $159 shipped I jumped all over it. That is DIRT CHEAP for a slip-on, and it looks like a quality piece. DG has been around a while too, catering mostly to ATV's, and while the brand isn't considered to be the best, it certainly is respectable. I believe if their attempt to break into the motorcycle market takes hold this price will go up.I'm no expert in metallurgy, but I'm guessing the pipe is stainless steel, the outer muffler is polished aluminum, and the front and back end caps are cast aluminum - all of which are corrosion resistant and should look nice for many years. Even the hex screws that attach the end caps (and allow access to the NFS approved spark arrestor and muffler packing) appear to be stainless steel. (UPDATE - Nope. A magnet test on the screws has since confirmed them to be just steel... very shiny steel. Chrome plated maybe?) There are no painted surfaces to scratch, fade, or chip. There was no ugly, weak, strap-type bracket to install. All mounting points were welded on. It fit perfectly, came with everything I needed, took me about 30 minutes to install from start to finish, and it looks great on the bike.To get the most performance you should re-jet. My bike was already jetted bigger in anticipation of a pipe and was a bit rich, so the DG exhaust instantly made it run better. There was a marked power increase down low in the RPM range. It revs quicker from just above idle to low mid-range. This is right where I need it 90% of the time, but after that you're just making more noise.There are a few things that prevent a 5 star review - 1) This thing is LOUD - as in OBNOXIOUS. It sounds almost like a piece of straight pipe. I was behind a super loud Harley at a red light once and he revved his engine to be cool, and a little old lady on the sidewalk screamed and dropped her groceries. The paper bag split and fresh vegetables etc went rolling in all directions. I don't get off on terrorizing grandmothers and impugning cops. Thankfully there are 4 or 5 different diameter quiet inserts available for about $25 a piece, each supplying a different noise level. The 1     insert is the quietest (94 decibels claimed) and makes the least power, but it is still supposed to be more powerful than with the stock exhaust. Though it does lessen the value factor, I will be ordering that one and plan to use it most of the time. 2) I wish the exhaust plume were directed more down and towards the side. Unlike with the stock muffler, the hot, unimpeded exhaust gasses now liberally bathe the right side of the plastic fender. If any discoloration begins to occur I'm thinking I might even fabricate and install a curved tail piece to direct things away from the back of the bike. We shall see if all that becomes necessary. (UPDATE - This was completely resolved by remounting the pipe with the bracket on top of the blinker bracket instead of under it. That and a slight     tweaking     of the mounting brackets. Wish I had thought to try this before I melted a tail light.) And 3) It seems to me to be on the heavy side for an aftermarket pipe.Anyway, all in all the good far outweighs the bad. I am pleased with my purchase. If your goal is to gain a little power, make some serious noise, look good doing it, and get better than average value for your money, the DG O Series Slip-on Exhaust might just be the pipe for you!

"  I do field service motor repair and needed something to give me an RPM.  This works, to a point.If you're familiar with real strobe lights, you know they  #34;freeze #34; the shaft view: e.g., a white line drawn on the pulley looks like a white line when synced. The Pyle doesn't, but rather the white line looks like a whitish arc of about 30. As you change the LEDs' flash speed, a particular artifact on the rotating part -- say, a largish scratch -- will slowly appear to quit rotating.  But it never really comes in focus: you can simply see that the various scratches don't seem to be moving. Or a fan blade appears as a larger fuzzy blade.  Sorry, it's hard to explain.  I suppose it's because the multiple LEDs' turn on / turn off times are not fast enough, or aren't exactly synchronized together (at typical motor speeds).  But even given that limitation, you can tell what the speed is, which is what you want to know.Its operation is fairly easy.  The Power button turns it on, but does not activate the flash, which is invoked from a button on the right side. It powers up in the Gross Adjust mode.  Use that to get within a range, then press the Fine button to creep into the sweet spot ( #34;Fine #34; is displayed on the LCD screen).  The LEDs are bright enough to work from a reasonable distance, say three feet. The display maintains its last mark when you stop the LEDs, which is helpful.  I haven't verified battery life, nor its toughness, though I've been carrying it in my toolbag for awhile and it still works.  I don't use the included carrying case, since it's so big.The thing you need to be careful about is that you will see the sync image at multiples of the rotating speed, so you must start from the bottom and work your way up.  That's not too tedious, since the Gross adjust goes quickly, and you can usually tell when it's approaching sync.Be seriously aware that a slow LED flash can cause problems with people prone to seizures, so do be careful about that.In short, for a fast, cheap way of determining RPMs, the Pyle does what it claims.  It's just not a real Strobe.  ",Overpriced

"  Replaced factory Suzuki horn with low-tone Freeway Blaster. Not much louder than OEM, but had more satisfying tone.  Horn lasted about a month and then started sounding like it had strep throat and began croaking.  It's a nice, inexpensive initial purchase, but replacing it every month may reduce cost savings substantially.  For that reason, I give it no more than a 2.

"  I received this antenna as a gift, so I didn't personally purchase this through Amazon.Installation is really easy after you do all the necessary cleaning and prep (alcohol wipe down to remove the wax).1. Just unscrew the original antenna off the mount.2. Tape the alignment guide on your car.3. Attach the helix wire with the provided screw.4. Remove the cover of the 3M double sided tape and place the shark fin (Beat-Sonic calls it a Dolphin antenna) cover down over the factory antenna base and between the cutout in the alignment guide and press down to make the cover stick on your roof.Simple as that.  It took me about 10 minutes.It's painted to match the original color of your car so the installation looks factory and cool.  But.......you do lose some antenna gain.  I tuned onto popular local AM stations (for those of you in the Los Angeles area, the stations I used were KNX 1070 and 790 KABC) during installation.  When I made the connection as described in step 3 above, the radio reception was just as good as the factory antenna.  This was a dry test fit, so I didn't remove the cover of the double sided tape.  As I was lowering the fin cover over the factory base (step 4) I started to lose the signal (more static).  I removed my hand just to make sure my body wasn't blocking any of the signal, but no improvement.  I lifted the fin cover off and the signal came back.  Bottom line, the shark fin cover is not totally RF transparent and you are going to lose signal.If you live in a major city, this may not be an issue.  If you're far from the city and constantly struggling to get an AM signal, then I would not recommend this antenna.If I were to rate this on a scale from 1 to 10: Installation - 10; cool factor - 10; Performance - 7  ",No Comment

"  I got this to use to hook up extra items in my truck.  The selling point was the USB port.  I have 3 items that charge via usb, and thought hey, one size fits all right.  It works great up front, the plug that goes in to your existing lighter is low profile and fits very well, the 3 outlets are properly sized (several chis units are just plane to big or small)  The case is nice plastic and does not bend or anything when you handle it.  I put some screws in to it and mounted it inside my glove compartment.  The LED is nice because it is red (blue is just silly)  Red is great because it matches the dash lights and does not glare at night and ruin night vision while driving.Here is the only down side.  I plugged in my cell phone (a Tmobile Google My Touch) via a usb to mini usb cable.  It starts to charge but gets nowhere.  My phone dies jsut a little bit slower and if you are talking to texting it seems to not help at all.  I plugged in my GPS and same results.  I tried a few items, and asked the Apple Store about the problem.  They say they have the same issue with ipods/iphones/ipads.  It is so simple no one caught it.You assume power is power.  The apple issue is how many MW not Volts and it translates to here as well.  This jack puts out less than 500mw.  The iPad requires almost 5000mw, Ipods are in the 1000mw range, and my cell phone requires 1200mw.  What this means is you wont damage your device, however with such little power, it is unlikely going to charge.  It will show a charge indicator but remember my phone, needing more than double the power to properly charge.  Now i am sure if left for a long period, or if you were just trying to maintain a phone a little longer it may help.  However for it's intended purpose is does not work.  It is sad but the rest of the unit works great, I just use the car charger still and no usb.  ",Underpriced

If you're looking for engine monitoring it's got a lot of options for you to set up and keep an eye on your gauges.  As far as a tuner giving you increased HP and torque I can't say I've noticed anything.  I'm not getting any MPG improvement and there's no noticeable improvement or power.  I have a 2014 6.0 Vortec engine and I can't feel a bit of difference running regular or premium.  I've heard from some others that it they're getting a boost in power but if you're running a Silverado with a 6.0 don't plan on getting much out of this but a gauge display.  Maybe they'll come out with an improved tune but for now it's a bust.  There's no tune for running E85 either which I find strange considering so many vehicles are FlexFuel now.  I'll keep downloading their updates as they come since I've already spent the money but buyer beware that you may spend a few hundred dollars and not get any gain.,Overpriced

It did not want to straiten out and wanted to kink. I had been for warned about nylon tube. I ended up using steel braided line instead. Overall though the cost of the gauge is worth it. I would note that if you plan on using anything other than the tubing that comes with it make sure you plan before install. The 1/4 connector on the back of the gauge could throw you a curve, The brided line I used was 1/8 NPT which was same as my sending unit in the block. Overall great gauge and worth the price.

"  2/23/11 - Update: Well, we recently used this in very bright sunlight, with the GPS placed on the dashboard. Unfortunately, the sunlight totally washed out the GPS screen, and since the angle of the mount is not adjustable, there wasn't anything I could do to make the screen easier to see. Had to keep the GPS balanced in the cupholder. It would have been great to have a few different angle adjustments to minimize this problem. I've dropped my rating down to 3 stars.___Original review - In California, until recently it was illegal to mount a GPS (or anything else) on the windshield. That meant that you either needed to affix a GPS mount to the dashboard, possibly marring the surface over time, or deal with the slipping and sliding of a loose unit as you drove. I was in the latter camp, and ended up putting the GPS in the cup holder more often than not, occasionally picking it up to make sure I was heading in the right direction.I actually spent quite a bit of time looking for solutions to this problem. Believe it or not, no one seemed to make a non-adhesive GPS mount for the dashboard. I tried a beanbag for a while, but this was obviously not the best solution (people gave me funny looks when they saw a Beanie Baby on my dashboard).This mount by Heininger is exactly what I was looking for. It is a molded soft foam/latex frame which has a grippy bottom to keep everything in place on your dashboard, an angled design to keep the GPS at a good viewing angle, and an open back in case you have cords to attach to the GPS. Most importantly, once you get to your destination you can just throw the mount on the floor so that no one knows you have a GPS unit in your car.The only significant downside is that since there is technically nothing that is keeping your GPS unit in place except gravity, sudden turns or stops/starts can potentially cause the GPS unit to tumble out of the mount. As long as that doesn't fit your driving style, this mount should work well for you. Also, it is somewhat on the large side, which allows a widescreen GPS to fit nicely in it, but it may be too big for some smaller units, such as the TomTom One.  ",Underpriced

"  I don't know how you make such a great product that is mostly unusable unless you know how to splice electrical wiring.  I took this out of the package and visually inspected it, and thought, wow this is really built well.  I inserted a lighter type plug into it and it locked in like it would never let go.  I looked at the length and thought, well, it seems OK to me for my little Honda CBR500R.  Now the mistake I made was thinking I had enough handlebar to mount this, which I don't.  My fault.  So I decided to hang it on a wire bundle leaving the left handle bar.  Routing it virtually straight back to the battery, it *just* made it.  It wouldn't have from the handle bar, and certainly not from anywhere I might have chosen to drill a hole for mounting in the fairing.

I'm happy with the output of the lights, they make a big difference.  I like the all-plastic mounting because I wanted everything black.CONS:  Can't think of anything.  I am happy with this purchase.  Be careful if you try to adjust them after they have been on for a while, they get HOT!OVERALL:  This is a good set of decent lights for a decent price.  I plan on buying another pair of this series for a different location on my Jeep.  I would recommend these lights.  ",Underpriced
"  Light output is decent, especially for the small price but these are definitely not a spot light. These lights are the definition of a flood pattern, as such, the light does not stretch nearly as far as I'd hoped. Also, the mounting bracket looks and feels like it was designed by a 3-year old.

It's brighter than the factory bulb and gives the mostly white light appearance I was looking for. The circuit board these are created on is very thick and took a little pushing to get into the light socket, but it seems to work.I can't tell if this is triggering a bulb out error as the Cadillac doesn't display any errors on the dash.

"  Took only about a half hour to mount these on the upper cab of my older John Deere 955 which I use to plow and blow snow. What a difference!  The light from two of these lights is at least five times that of the cheap halogens I had previously mounted on my tractor cab. They are GREAT, white and bright and use almost no current.  The older 955 has a small alternator and now it will no longer have to suffer running the two 30W halogens I was using. Additionally, two of these is more affordable than buying any of the available light bars I had found on the web.. I highly recommend these and dearly hope they last, they are worth every penny paid. Thanks Amazon for offering them. Assembling the brackets to the light  takes longer than mounting the lights. The trick is to just drop that nut in the slot and let the bolt threads find their home.

"  Didnt want to spend like 300+ dollars on a Rigid Industries LED bar if I could get a quality one at a decent price, and this one fits the bill.  Just mounted it to my brush gaurd in place of 2 little 55w Baja Halogen lights which were a pain since they would bounce around a little on nasty potholes and it really sucks getting 2 spotlight beams to perfectly align all the time.  Havent used it at night but im waiting til it gets dark and ill update the review.  Having an older 2nd gen 4runner with a brush guard in front of the headlights really sucks for visibility at night, even with those Baja lights on its still hard to see far enough ahead when your going 50+ mph.  Anyways this unit seems really well built, has solid cast aluminum mounts with rubber bushings to keep it from vibrating.  No harness so we installed a Delphi Weatherpack kit (about $6) for a true plug   play setup, not to mention it looks really professional and clean with the harness and shrink wrap.  When buying LED fixtures for off road they should have a MINIMUM IP rating of 64,  RIGID INDUSTRIES I think are IP68,  these are very close at IP67:The two numbers in the IP67 rating code rating refer to:6 -      Dust Protected     ; Totally protected against dust ingress.; complete protection against contact7-      Immersion Protected     ; Protected against short periods of immersion in water.Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion). Test duration: 30 minutes;  Immersion at depth of at least 1 m measured at bottom of device, and at least 15 cm measured at top of deviceSo unless your mounting these to your underwater submarine they should do just fine under normal, and by normal I mean severe off road, conditions.  Odds are if these LED's stop working because of water damage you'll probably be getting a new vehicle too.  God help anybody who cuts me off at night now!  ",Underpriced

"  Good quality lights. I have owend KCs before and have always been happy. I recently upgraded all my lights to HID.  I stumbled across these and figured I'd give them a shot. Well even though they are made of plastic, they seem very stout and solid. I kind of like the fact that they will not rust like the metal ones do over time. They are alot more solid than other plastic housing lights I've owen from some of the competitors.  These still use the fluted glass design as the lens rather than the free form reflector design which I dont care for. Being HID these are a nicely reasonably priced light compared to other options. They seem to have a decent beam pattern and light up the night very well. I chose the driving lights over the spots simply because I wanted a little spread sacrificing some distance. Well even in driving beam these reach out plenty for my needs. They are alot brighter than halogens and have a built in ballast unlike some. Even the wiring harness is of good quality, alot better than some others I have owened. Plenty of wire provided to reach where needed. The bulb kelvin color in these is just about perfect, a nice warm color. I would say right about 4500k give or take, which is about the perfect balance between true white with a hint of yellow to go easy on the eyes, unlike others that are 5k or 6K which is a tad too much blue and strains the eyes some.  I have the warn 7000s, which is a 7 #34; hid and I think for the money these are a better buy. My warns put out a tad more blue color than I like, prob about 6K.  Although I mounted these KC 6 #34; ers up on the windsheild pillars of my jeep, I wish I had a set of these in the 8 #34;er version down on my bumper instead of the warns really. I think the 8 #34; version would prob perform a tad better and would compliment these 6 #34; KCs very well. I wouldnt say they are top of the line hids by any means, but for the average wheeler that does trails, they are exactly what I was looking for and live up to my expectations completly for the price. Well worth the little extra over the standard halogen models. Of course the excellent KC 23 year warranty helps also. So if you break them or they go out on you, send them back and they will give you new ones or repair them, you cant go wrong. If you are a desert racer and want a super high quality HID, then fork out the dough and buy one of the more expensive higher top of the line models. Again, for what I needed these fit the bill pretty well. Also for those that are considering buying some cheap halogen lights and retrofit them over to hid, well why bother? These are what your looking for. By the time you buy a cheap hid kit, some cheap lights, hack them up and install the hid bulbs into the housings and then have half arss quality light focus with big ballast boxes mounted externally exposed to the elements and looking ugly, you can have these instead. They are alot cleaner and provide what you were looking for in the first place with a good warranty and less hassle to boot.  ",Underpriced

"  This is the second set I've ordered.

There is no substitute to having your brakes visually inspected every time you service your vehicle.Also, if the sensor is replaced, chances are the brake pad warning will light up in your dash.

Crankshaft Position Sensor install is practically common sense.  On the 2.4L The notch matches position on the crank gear with the tooth having the dimple.  After you install the plate if you can't see the dimple when looking through the notch then you put the plate in flipped backasswards.  Your timing belt would get eaten soon and the plate would soon hit the position sensor pickup if you don't put it in correctly.  To install a new plate in means getting the gear off.  I use a pipe from an old chain link fence gate and slip it over my breaker bar and tap the starter.  That trick has worked each of 3 times on three different vehicles.

But the Canadian plant did not and allowed any water that ended up under the hood to pool over the knock sensors. The obvious result? It rusts and stops working which throws up the check engine light. And you have to take off the intake manifold to get at it.When you go through that much effort, and don't know if it works until everything is put back into place, you don't want any possible problems.

"  This was the cheapest I was able to find this product and it was fortunately easy to replace. Don't forget to pick up the special slotted socket for your torque wrench or this will be kinda impossible to install due to the cable sticking out.I bought this for my 2005 Nissan Altima 4 cylinder and am glad I went with this rather than the much more expensive options out there. Apparently these sensors DO wear out and as my car was approaching 100k miles it was around the right time for it to crap out. Supposedly I was supposed to replace the other fuel ratio and oxygen sensors at the same time but the error code I got from the engine specifically mentioned this one so I'll go with just this one unless one of the others starts complaining too.One thing to note is that during installation (Sensor 1 Bank 1 is an easy reach in the front of the motor about halfway down from the top) there is a clip that holds the electrical connector side in place and I found that this needed to be installed FIRST because otherwise, the cabling was about an inch too short for me to get attach it AFTER the sensor was already screwed into the engine. If you don't want too much twisting in the cable then pre-twist it in the opposite direction prior to installing it so it'll be more or less right once it's done. Maybe on your cars this won't be a problem but for mine it was.  ",Underpriced

Got the part in 2 days, and I have to say, I was very happy with the customer service. I would shop with Precision European Motorworks again.  ",Underpriced

"  After going way too long with my tailgate dropping down and banging my head every time I stood underneath it I finally got around to replacing the shocks.These supports are half the price of comparable parts sold in my local auto store. They look identical to the factory parts I replaced. It's a little confusing that they didn't come with any product information card, warranty info, or printed instructions, though I did find instructions in a PDF here at Amazon. Installation took 15 minutes for both struts and required only a 10mm driver and a flat head screwdriver.What an improvement! The gate rises gently after it's opened more than 6    . It's a tad stiff to pull down to close, but I'll take that over being bopped in the head.  ",Underpriced

Very good product! Very quick delivery too! It's actually the third one I've prurchased. The only thing I'd change is the rate in which the tailgate lowers. On my GMC Sierra it's a little too fast. On my Ford F150 it was slower.,No Comment

"  The tail gate on my 2003 PT Cruiser Limited Edition was not staying up reliably and was very hard to open. The final straw was when the tail gate fell on my wife's arm, badly bruising her upper arm. I guess we were lucky it didn't hit her in the head and knock her down.I bought a pair of these lifts and they exceeded my expectations. NOTE: You will need a 40 Torx driver (six pointed) to remove the old lifts and install the new ones. You will also need someone to hold the tail gate up for you during the process. The process of removing the old lifts and installing the new ones is easy and takes only 15 minutes, or so.After the new lifts were installed, the tail gate not only stays up, it is much easier to open. Now the tail gate opens with only minimum effort. In fact, once started, it practically opens itself. I am extremely pleased with these lifts and I expect they will perform for some years to come.

"  Same quality as stock, at least, on my 2003 Honda Element. This is no joke: it took me longer to read the instructions on how to install them than it did to install them (the instructions aren't crystal clear but they're pretty good; once you figure out how to release the old ones it's probably about as difficult as replacing a gas cap). Less than four minutes and I had both units replaced. Didn't need an assistant, just opened the hatch, used a screwdriver to release the catch and pop the top and bottom ends off. Closed the hatch while I grabbed the replacement unit, opened the hatch, popped it in place. Then repeated for the other side. The new strut had enough oomph to hold the hatch by itself. The only     complaint     is that the hatch is harder to close, slightly. Much offset by the fact that I don't bump my forehead anymore. Definitely worth the money.  ",Underpriced

These are plenty strong and were relatively easy to install using a flat head screw driver to hold the clip open.  The hardest part is getting the old one of because you somehow have to hold the hood up while changing out the first one.  I used the top of my head.  While extremely uncomfortable for a few minutes its possible for an able bodied 25 yr old man.  If you are weaker I would ask for an extra set of hands.

"  I installed a pair of westin tubes almost 10 years ago.  After they rusted off, I got the aluminum sure step and this installation kit.  Probably the worst instructions I have ever seen.  Seriously, how hard is it to write some decent instructions. I could spend 10 minutes and write a better set of instructions.  After you get one side done, you figure it out.  The worst offense is that the brackets aren't engineered to fit correctly.  The bracket will bend the lower lip of the sheet metal as you tighten down the bolts.  It should have been at 90 degrees, but it is at about 80 degrees so the thin metal is stressed.  The bolts are barely big enough to get threaded, because of the incorrectly engineered bracket.  Once you finally get it threaded, it starts to bend the metal out.  Like the other poster mentioned, the self tapping screws are barely long enough and you have to be very delicate while drilling and set the clutch on the drill low so you don't drill out the hole completely like I did on my first hole.  I'm not convinced it will hold.  I may tack weld the brackets on if it gets loose.  I'm not thrilled about drilling holes in my truck.  There are plenty of factory holes and options that should have been utilized.  I wish I had gone with a different option/brand.  With stressed metal and questionable self tapped screws, not sure how long this will last.  I'm pretty sure I will need to weld these on at some point, if I don't just rip them off and start with a different brand.  This is on a 2001 F150 supercrew.  ",Overpriced

"  The second strut went in with no problems, great product ! That being said: strut #1 was in and bottom bolts tightened when two of the top bolts snapped off, I know the first sounded like the torque wrench snapping so I did it again, I should of snapped the third one off and saved even more time, I did the third one with a box wrench by hand, very lightly and snapppp, aaarrrggghhh ! I replaced the bolts with 3/8 X 16 X 3/4 #9 bolts from lowes with lock washers. I had to compress the spring and loosen the nut but it had just enough clearance. So my 1/2 hr job turned into an all day affair, considering that the local auto store wanted $440 in labor I still consider a positive day was had, good thing I had access to another car though to get extra parts.Who ever is supplying the little bolts on the top plate should be replaced by teneco or monroe, I've been turning wrenchs for 40 yrs and also used to work in a tool and die shop that made dies for header bolts so I know a defective bolt when I get one! Still I love the new ride but if your doing this yourself, make sure you have a spring compressor just in case and whatever you do     BE CAREFULL WITH THE TOP BOLTS     !Lastly this has nothing to do with amazon, I could of put the car back together and sent the defective unit back and who knows what would of been said back and forth as to the bolts quality? I just ordered the two rear struts and at the price I'm getting them and the difference in ride I am very happy with the end result and     pepbays     can thank their tack on extras of $160 to losing my business, they just couldn't let go of that hundred bucks, ha saved me $440. Some people have model airplanes, I have my saturn.  ",Underpriced
"  I bought these shocks for my 2006 Chevrolet Express 3500 Van. I was troubled after comparing the new shock to the OEM shock. They are not exactly alike. The original shock has a large rubber isolator with a steel sleeve, and a long upper post. The Monroe shock looks the same on the lower mount, but the upper isolator is MUCH smaller than the original, and looks like it belongs on a half-ton truck. I contacted Monroe   they assured me that the replacement shock will work work fine in this application. I've been driving with the new shocks for a week and they have helped soften the ride somewhat. Just be sure to re-tighten the upper mounting nut AFTER the truck is sitting on the front wheels. Over-all I am satisfied with these shocks.  ",Underpriced

"  I purchased these Monroe quick-struts 2 1/2 years ago to replace a broken coil spring on my wife's 02 Focus (a common problem for that vintage Focus, thanks Ford). They were ideal for my situation because I got the whole spring/strut assembly for about what I would have paid for just springs. As a bonus, I didn't have to mess around with compressing the springs, as it was just a matter of bolting the new assembly into place. They were an exact replacement fit and they ride the same as the stock spring/struts (note: the car seemed to ride 'higher' for a few months, but the springs have since settled in). I would have reviewed them earlier but after installing them, I began hearing faint suspension related noises and held off until I tracked down the source. That turned out to be a failing motor mount (again, thanks Ford). Long story short, I completely forgot to review these struts. So with the hindsight of 2 1/2 years and 28,000 miles, I can report they are still working beautifully. No leaks at the struts, springs are in good shape, and an overall stock like handling suspension.  ",Underpriced

"  I purchased a set of these for my brother's Ford Taurus, as the rear struts in his car were shot. We installed these, along with new sway links, and the rear of the car looked like it was dragging on the ground. The springs mounted on these struts are horribly inferior to the struts that were on the car beforehand. Due to it nearing winter months, it was getting pretty cold, so we decided to leave them on the car until spring, when we would get better quality struts and replace these.To make make the story even better, the low quality springs on these ended up causing the rear of the car to constantly     bottom out     over moderate bumps, if anybody was sitting in the rear seat. We ended up replacing them before spring, as one of the strut mounts completely gave out. It broke right around where the strut connected to the mount. The breakage is believed to have been caused by the things bottoming out all the time.They lasted about 6-months and have since been returned as a defective product, to Amazon, under warranty for a refund.STEER CLEAR OF THIS GARBAGE!

  the seller was great.  The product arrived right away in new condition.  Packaging was not damaged.  Product was well packaged. One issue out of many parts ordered. One of the shocks had a factory defect in which the metal sleeves were not completely pressed into position within the rubber bushing.  They were left sticking out 1/4     on one side and recessed on other side.  The defect was found on both ends of the shock. This made the ends of the shock too large to fit within the vehicle mounting brackets.  Luckily I was able to press the sleeves into place with an arbor press and use the product.  ,Underpriced

"  The Raybestos sway bar links for our 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan were a great replacement for the worn out OEM units.  Installation on the new struts was very simple.  The most difficult part (especially if not replacing the struts) is removing the old units.  I had to use a sawzall to cut the ball joints off, but since I was replacing the strut, I only cut the bottom from the sway bar.  I left the top attached to the strut so that I could remove the strut and link as one piece from the car.If you are keeping the struts, use a penetrating oil (PBlaster or equivalent) for several days prior to attempting to remove the old links.

"  Recently my Toyota 1996 Camry LE showed the symptom of needing to turn the key several times for it to start. I bought the starter kit and a Stanley 201-piece tool set to fix this problem. From beginning to finish, the task took me 2.5 hours (1.5 hours on taking the starter motor/solenoid out; 15 minutes on replacing the parts using the kit and cleaning the solenoid, and 45 minutes putting everything back together). Replacing the parts using the kit is really easy; what's difficult for me are loosening the two 14mm screws fixing the starter motor/solenoid and the engine (i.e., super tight and in confined space).  ",Overpriced
"  I used this product to replace my failing solenoid contacts on my 1999 Toyota Corolla.  Toyota will not sell these items individually to you, so the alternative was to buy a new starter from Toyota or a refurbished starter from Toyota both being in the $300 - $200 range respectively.  Another alternative was going to the auto parts store and purchasing a cheap Mexican made starter motor for my Toyota.  The problem with the aftermarket unit is that the quality does not come close or compare to the quality of the Japan made Denso unit that comes with the Corolla.  After researching the starting issues I had with my vehicle and using a simple voltmeter (which was also purchased on Amazon) to confirm the issue.  I made the decision to buy this part from vendor Crank N Charge.  Their staff is knowledgeable and shipped the item right away.Essentially if your Toyota has a good battery and your car goes click, click, click intermittently before it starts, more than likely the solenoid contacts need to be replaced.  I'm mechanically inclined so I took it upon myself to remove the starter from the vehicle, open the unit, disassemble, clean and replace with new components.  Finally the reassembly of the starter and the installation back into the vehicle.  Now my car starts WITHOUT ANY ISSUES WHATSOEVER.  This gives me tremendous peace of mind and saved me countless dollars by just investing some time into a my solid workhorse vehicle.The parts purchased were aftermarket, they are not Denso parts.  The quality seems to be excellent, as the parts consist of two simple copper pieces and a plunger with a copper ring.  Take the time to rebuild the starter correctly to avoid any electrical shorts and this time investment will pay itself off.  I hope this review helps others handle a $300 starter issue with essentially $13 worth of parts.  ",Underpriced

"  I heard a lot of good things from a lot of good places about POR-15, and having been on my car about a month, I've got nothing but good things to say about it as well.  I chose to buy the kit over everything separately, simply because I was only buying it for a few small rust spots on my car (early 90's Honda's are rustbuckets. So reliable though!).  I strongly suggest you review what you're going to be painting and get a good idea how much paint you're going to need.  The reason I gave the product 4 stars, is that you really need to finish your coats and do everything you want to do with the paint in one shot.  It dries so fast that it may very well be dry in the can by the next day.  And that's it, it turns completely solid, and has no use but taking up space in a garbage bag.  I don't know if the other POR-15 cans are like this, but again, try to size up what you need so you don't end up wasting a ton.Aside from that, everything is wonderful.  The marine clean and the metal ready work well, some reviews say they're not necessary, I think they very much are.  Especially if you're doing exactly what POR-15's purpose is: painting over rust.  I don't think the paint would have adhered very well if I just tried to brush all the metal flakes and dust off with my bare hand.  The paint is pretty easy to work with too, it's thick and is easy to apply on bumpy rusty steel.  Be very careful with it though!  If you drop it, whatever it splashes is on black forever.  It'll also be on your hands for days if you get any on yourself.  The rubber gloves came for a reason, use them at all times.  Take your time, do a good job.  It will look great, and stop the rust from spreading where you're painted.  ",Underpriced

"  I decided to go with a rebuilt AC/Delco over the other products and it cost me the price of a replacement pump PLUS labor I could have done myself.  The item arrived as promised, pulley was pressed on by a pro and installed with a simple three-bolt application.  Took the vehicle in for State safety inspection and the State inspector found fluid leaks on the PS-pump, so I had to pay an additional $70 mechanic fee to replace the rebuilt AC/Delco I just purchased: with another pump from the mechanics provider.  The issue was not the pump mechanism, but the reservoir that was part of the pump purchased.  It appears they may have missed a quality control check on the reservoir which resulted in the one I received leaking at the seams on back of the reservoir.  So for the few bucks I saved, here are the additonal costs:$69.00 new PS pump (but will be refunded by Amazon)$20.00 non-refunded core charge since I have to return this product to Amazon$70.00 mechanic labor charge (not kidding, just to change 3-bolts)$  8.00 2-bottles of power steering fluidSo nearly $100.00 additional out of pocket (and that is if I don't have to replace the $20.00 pulley I just purchased)I will always continue to purchase through Amazon as their customer care and return policy is very customer friendly, but on items like these, do yourself a favor and go for the new if this is any sign of the quality/inspection control for the rebuilts/remanufactured.

"  The LED is only visable when something is plugged into it. In my opinion, there should be a lighted ring around the socket so that it can be easily visable at all times and as an indicator that there is power at the device. also, the crimp connectors do not fit tightly enough and if you try and solder them on, you will melt the plastic housing. overall cheap and not well thought out. not to mention that the boot that goes over the back to protect the wiring and connnections does not stay on and will just fall off. there is no way to permenantly attach it to the housing.

"  I read the negative review from a few years ago, and still thought to myself, they cant be that bad.  I drive a lowered civic, with aftermarket header and exhaust.  I'm use to a rough and loud ride, i figured these mounts cant make that much of a difference, its not like I'm use to driving a Cadillac, Wow was I wrong. After two weeks, i pulled these out today and installed new regular rubber mounts.Good:  these inserts fit perfectly into the stock mounts, even though one of my mounts was completely torn into two pieces. They are easy to install and fit securely into the mounts. They are a good product.Bad: These inserts basically turn your mounts into solid mounts. Every Vibration from the engine transferred directly to the cars body.  This isnt to bad at cruising speed, but was terrible at idle.  At stoplights, my front bumper rattled, the steering wheel shook, Sunroof cover rattled, the change in my center console danced around, etc...  On top of that there was a heavy drone inside the car, from the lack of sound deadening, coupled with the vibration.Opinion:  If you need solid mounts for a high power car/race car, and you dont care about excessive noise, these are perfect for you.  If you need new mounts for the car you drive everyday, spend the money and get new rubber mounts, you will be much happier.  ",Overpriced

"  I recently purchased a 2001 Chevy Suburban 1500 LS, 2 wheel drive.  When I got the vehicle home, I found several minor problems I needed to fix.  One of these problems was that the side power and heated rear view mirrors would move up, but not down, left, or right.  The passenger side mirror was broken, and was replaced, but the remote control would not function except to move the mirrors up.I looked here and found this switch.  I was encouraged because in appearance it was an almost perfect match for the switch I needed to replace.  The only difference was that my existing switch had black buttons, and this one was grey.  When I attemtped to order it, the drop down menus to check compatability appeared at the top of the page, asking for year, make, and model of the vehicle.  When that information was entered, the system advised that this switch would not fit my vehicle.  None of the other switches shown were even close in appearance.  I took a chance and ordered the switch anyway.  It arrived today, and except for color was an exact match of my exisitng switch.  It took less than 5 minutes to exchange the switches, and the mirrors worked perfectly.  I suggest that the compatability feature be looked at, and readjusted.  According to the system, this was not the proper switch for my vehicle, when in fact, it was.  ",Overpriced

"  WHere does all that noise come from?  Is it the springs in the clutch?  Is it the valve train?  (sounds like lugging the engine at low RPMs and throttle).  Its a shame that we can't have our cake and eat it too.The flywheel creates a much more responsive engine.  It is quite noticeable.  The only thing I did was replace the clutch and flywheel, and it was a completely different car when I pulled it out of the garage.  Other than the noise, excellent.  It feels a lot stronger.  Revs faster.  Might be a lot of seat of the pants due to removing the buffered dual mass flywheel.  It feels like the engine is attached to the wheels a lot more than it used to.Clutch pedal feels better than stock, but not firm.  Still less firm than my wife's focus ST.Again, other than the noise, it didn't lose any of its drivability.  Just a shame about the noise.  I suppose an excuse to get a loud exhaust.What else can you do when your stock clutch isn't handling your horsepower?

I installed the second replacement a couple thousand miles ago, and it's driving great so far. These may not be oem quality and may not last as long, but the price is right. I love getting excuses to work on my car when I can, so I don't mind replacing these every 2 to 3 years.If you are a rough driver like me and don't want to deal with having to do this repair occasionally, I'd recommend going oem or raxles. If you are an easy driver and/or like to save money and work on your car, I'd recommend cardone select.  ",Underpriced

If you like the stock flywheel you will not be disappointed with this.

"  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It is totally garbage! I had to replace the oil cooler lines on my 2000 Blazer, so I found this piece of crap(didn't know at the time). I removed the old one because it was leaking where the steel met the rubber. First of all, when I went to install the new one, (mind you, this is a     direct fit     part)one of the hoses kinked....are you kidding me???!!! So anyway, I used about 5 zip ties around that area to prevent it from kinking. I installed this part in October, 2011. Here it is April, 2012, I decided to do an oil change and when I went to replace the filter, I looked up through the access door, and this     wonderful     piece of automotive engineering looked like it was about 100 years old! The rubber part of the assembly was all dried out, cracked, and starting to leak. I suppose I could get a replacement under warranty, but I don't want to get stuck doing this job again in another 6 months. The original one lasted for 160,000 miles. Just goes to show, when it says     made in China    , it's junk. Unfortunately, 90% of everything in this country is made in China nowadays.

"  I just finished installing this part.  While it may be as good as original, I can't rate it any better for the following reasons:  As other reviewers noted, it is different from original, there are NO instructions, and it is missing parts (2 nuts as mentioned in other reviews).  Some may be smarter or luckier than me, but I found it to be a royal pain to figure out correct angle/installation.  As for the references to YouTube instructions, from what I found (and I looked) there are no videos that cover the most difficult part of job: how to fit in a part that looks considerably different from the one you just removed.  For those who are where I was 2 hours ago:- Get the 2 nuts (10 mm) before you try to install new part.- Attach the arm (to left) with the protruding bolts through door w/ new nuts.- Once this is in place, it may be easier to figure out how to attach part (it DOES fit).- When in place properly, the motor should sit in upper right corner, pointing straight up,  if you are looking at it straight on (as if you could see through the door panel); if you look down from above, you see the cylinder shape of top of motor).- The four original bolts (in rectangular pattern) will go in place once it is sitting properly.- You will have 3 extra bolts from original that aren't needed .Good luck.

"  I ordered the regulator to replace the one in my 2001 Chevy Silverado passengers door. The part arrived just as promised by Amazon. Opening the box I found the regulator, a piece of paper with information type on it describing the possible changes from the OEM part.  A small plastic bag with two nuts and a bolt in it. I removed the door panel. Taped the window and removed all the bolts. Removed the old regulator. Just as I figured the control cable had rusted and broken. I compared the new one to the OEM. On the bottom of the regulator where there was two bolts, there are welded studs on the new one.. Also, a support bracket mid way on the right side of the part is not present on the new one. It installed with ease. Studs lined up, all bolts lined up with no problems. Window clamps appeared to be the same as the OEM and tightened to the glass. Powered up and a few test runs all appeared to be fine. Time will tell.The paper work explained the difference of the OEM and the replacement with pictures, its a copy, but readable.I hope the missing support on the right side of the frame does not cause any problem later but time will tell.

While the Driver blade does clean it also throws excess water to the passenger side in a way that simply makes the passenger blade useless. Oh, speaking of useless, after two separate (new) blades were installed, the passenger side blade simply made NO contact with the windshield.

"  I bought a pair of these to replace the disintegrating OEM blades on a 2006 E91 BMW 325xi. Installation wasn't the easiest, as BMW, in its infinite complicating wisdom, uses a special pin mount instead of the usual U-hook. Attachment involved removing a piece from the blade mount, and forcing the slightly-too-small pin hole on the blade onto the slightly-too-large pin on the wiper arm. (There are two pin holes on the wiper mount: a little too small, and way too large.)Note that these blades are reversible on their mounts, to match the curvature of your windshield. The blade carrier separates from the piece that attaches to the wiper arm, and can be reattached facing either left or right. Until I figured this out, the left blade kept a triangle of windshield directly in front of the driver's face un-wiped. I'm guessing that this is probably in the manual, so do read it.As with other Rain-X blades I've installed on other cars, these wipe with the best.  ",No Comment

"  Love the Bosch wiper blades. The Evolution series are the best, as they have a cap that swings down and covers the entire insertion area of the wiper. Makes removing the wiper, later on, much easier, because the cap keeps dirt etc. out of the wiper to wiper arm connection area. Unfortunately, these do not fit the rear window of the Subaru Forester 2005, as Amazon's car part finder suggested. The size of the blade is correct, but the connector is wrong.The blade needs to have a large round plastic dowel across the middle of the insertion area, so that the dowel swings up into place on the car's wiper connector arm. The rear window of the 2005 Subaru Forester does not have the standard     push it on the hook of the connector arm     setup. The Advantage series is the same as the Evolution series minus the protection cap, so these should be an excellent blade overall.  ",Overpriced

"  I really love these blades and bought the winter and 31 series Anco wiper blades because of their high ratings and comparatively lower prices! This product is continually tested as the winter here in my neck of the woods drones on and is performing exceptionally.However, I have found one issue so far that I think would be useful to know about as a first time buyer. These wiper blades are rather un-aerodynamic. Above 55 mph (90 kph) these blades struggle to stay on the surface of my windshield. If it weren't for the     Rain-X     coating that I applied earlier this year, I don't know if I would have any visibility at all at freeway speeds.I have only been using these blades when I know a storm is coming and I'll just be going to work and making short local trips. I switch them out for the standard 31 series blades when I don't need them. I really don't mind it because visibility is something that I worry about more than most others may. I almost enjoy investing quite a bit of time and effort into fending off and conquering winter weather. Using them less and keeping them indoors while I'm not using them also means that these blades may last me a few years. I still do not regret the investment but am glad I also bought the 31 series at the same time.  ",Underpriced

We've been in a drought and I wasn't going to rush out in the middle of the few pop-up lightning storms we've had. Finally, all came together and I could test the wiper.Bottom line? It wipes.

"  It was with GREAT anticipation that I waited for my opportunity to acquire my Valeo Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season  22 #34; Wiper.  The stories of prowess shared by my fore-fathers were legendary.  My mother spoke of Valeo, himself, as the master of all wipers and was clearly the most superior at removing debris from surfaces.In driving through my neighborhood, I saw the drone lifting off from my neighbor's front yard.  Upon closer look, I saw a glow of light from the sky shining down on the box.  It was as though the heavens were shining down on the very cardboard box containing my 22 #34; wiper.  As I reached the front porch, I quickly realized the wiper must be inside.  (Of course, I realized this after I put the box in my car and drove directly home and into my garage, where I ripped open the box with my bare hands.)I have acquired many smiley face boxes in a similar manner, but this one was the box of all boxes.  Upon opening the box, the 22 #34; wiper instantly flew from the opening and began rubbing across my car.  The rust bubbles and mud disappeard, then i noticed the paint shined like new. I have no idea how it worked that magic, but it was as though Frosty the Snowman, himself, was behind it.  I thought 22 #34; wipers were only for glass windsheilds, but this 22 #34; one... this ULTIMATE All-Season Valeo 22 #34; wiper was not only 'All-Season,' but it was also 'All-Car' and 'All Miracle! #34;As it glided across the paint, scratches vanished.  Across the chrome, all pitting removed.  I was astonished to see rubber actually re-appear on the tire tread as it gently stroked across it.  By the time the wiper finished, my car not only looked new again, it was a completely different color.I assure you that if you buy this wiper, and use it on your car, you will be more than thrilled.WARNING:  Use on your wife at your own risk.  After seeing how it made my car look new, I could not help but wonder if it could do the same for my wife.  After using it on my wife, (just a light touch), she was transformed to the beautiful woman I married all those years ago.  Her body was all firm and tight with skin as beautiful and smooth as a baby's skin.  Unfornately, she took one look in the mirror and instantly left me for my neighbor who had ordered the 24 #34; wiper.  I never realized she would leave me just to get a man who had 2 more inches.

"  While I can't attest to the ease of installation, since Pep Boys installed the pair I presently have on my car - in 2009!!!  I just ordered my first replacement pair after 4 1/2 years.  (OK, so they probably should have been replaced a few months ago, but we didn't have much rain the last 3 months or so.)Even if they had lasted 1 year, I would have been happy, as I usually have to replace wiper blades 1-2X/year.  These wipers were subjected to 3 years in Houston and 1.5 in NJ, and survived 100 degree plus weather, drought (they didn't succumb to dry rot)and, conversely, Houston's notorious rainy weather when the drought finally ended, as well as the blizzard of 2010 that dumped 4' of snow in the Philly area.If this pair lasts as long, they may outlive the car (2002 Saab 9-3). I can't believe I'll get another 4 years out of a pair of wiper blades, but the good solid grip of these on the windshield at all speeds will guarantee clear vision in the worst weather, regardless of how long they last.

"  My car uses the 20A on the passenger side and the 26A on the drivers side.This blade is easy to install, and that's half the battle. Before you order from Amazon, be sure to use the pop-up link to find the proper size for your vehicle. The blades come in both A and B sizes and different lengths. Some vehicles take different lengths for each side of the wind-shield. My Ford Edge takes the 26 A and the 20A.  I did not see a size listed on the website for the rear window wiper.I went to the Bosch web site before installing and they have a wonderful, helpful video about installation. Just search it under     wiper blades     on their site. Lots of helpful information there, for someone who never had to change their old blades. The packaging was simple to open after seeing the video. No need for box cutters or scissors like some over packaged goods.Another helpful hint from the video is to place a towel on the windshield in case the blade snaps out of your hand. (prevent a cracked windshield). You are also told the some vehicles require the blade to be in a vertical position before replacing, so sit in the car and turn on the wiper until it is upright. I know it sounds simple to you mechanical types, but tips like these mean a lot to those of us who were used to Service Stations actually giving service and when the local gas station attendant would check your wipers if asked.This is a good product, works well and is easy to do it yourself.

The best test for how well a blade is working is to drive through a gale-force sleet storm and see how well you can see.

"  First, these blades are priced on the economical side so you will not get the sleek look of an expensive blade.  Personally, that is not something that matters to me, I am more concerned with performance and ease of installation.  I replaced my Altima's worn blades with this 17 #34; blade and a 28 #34; blade from this series. I was very happy with the 28 #34; blade but found performance of the 17 #34; blade to be just ok.First, installation was pretty simple.  I am not mechanical but I replaced both blades in about 5 minutes. However, the 17 #34; blades did not seem to have enough tension to lie flat on the windshield and left a lot of streaking where the last four inches of the blade met the glass.  I bent the blade a bit and that helped but there was still some streaking.  Not a lot but this is not an issue I've had with other 17 #34; replacement blades.  This is often a problem with the 28 #34; blades. Oddly, the 28 #34; companion blade worked very well! No streaking for that one. So, ok performance but nothing fantastic.  ",Underpriced

"  Agreeing with some critiques, the part that hooks onto the wiper arm is very bulky and is an eyesore.  The blade itself is low profile (as is with the new curved, steel-scaffolding-less wipers) but it is completely offset by the ugly plastic hump that joins the blade to the arm.  I was able to modify it to make it look far better than what it originally came as.  Be warned though that the stated lengths may not have the same exact proportions as the OEM-type wiper blades.  Some customers stated that the wipers are too short in some areas where it leaves a larger triangle left in the middle or they are too long that the blades nick eachother while being operated.  These are still good wipers with some shortcomings, thankfully of which did not affect me.Tips, I keep an older set of wipers on my car in the summertime because I may rarely use them.  I keep these on in the wintertime just because they are a bit pricier and don't want them to wear out so soon.  The older OEM style wipers can be refilled with just the rubber piece.  Once the Valeo ones go bad, you have to purchase the whole blade.  Summertime conditions can dry out and wear the rubber much faster.  At least the cold and perhaps wetter winter seasons can keep the rubber edges from going bad.  ",Overpriced

It is pre-curved and basically one piece. The curved blade is part of a curved frame that simply attaches to the wiper arm.Installation took about a minute. The hardest part was getting the Rain-X blade out of the package. Sprayed some Rain-x water repellent on the windshield after installing this (and a slightly different Rain-X blade for the passenger side -- smaller and not available in the Latitude series). The results were great. The blades moved across the windshield glass perfectly. No gaps, no streaks, no noise. I think the graphite coating on the Latitude makes a big difference.

"  This replacement wiper blade was a big disappointment. It looked a lot like the original(OEM) wiper blade, but that's where the similarity ends. The all important pivot post is supposed to clip into the wiper arm that is attached to the rear window. The attachment tab is weak with very little tension and nothing like the     beefy     original. In fact when I clipped it on the arm it was barely hanging on the arm, and I knew it fall off when I drove - never mind using it in the rain. Not wanting to return this crappy wiper blade and having to wait to find another wiper blade - I ended up swapping the rubber blade part from the new blade and sliding it into the old original wiper blade, and throwing the rest away. Had this not worked, I would have returned the product and rated it with 1 star. My advice would be to purchase the rubber blade part only, unless the arm itself is damaged.

"  This is the first wiper of this type that I have used (non-hinged frame type) and I have to say that I am impressed.  Usually at highway speeds, my regular wipers start to lift a bit or do not maintain full contact with the windshield, but these low profile wipers keep full contact along the full length, for a clear windshield.  There was no squeak or stutter at any time, even in light rain or when using washer fluid, and they were able to keep up with a full-on heavy rain, which some wipers do not seem to be able to do.  This 20a wiper fits the passenger side of a 2009 Sonata among others (use a 24a for the drivers side of the 2009 Sonata), and works as good or better than any other wiper I have tried so far.

"  Bottom line: I only gave these windshield wipers two stars because they don't have enough pressure at the end of the blade to wipe that area of the windshield. For their premium cost, they should do a spectacular job, I would not buy again.I bought these to replace a pair of windshield wipers that were great, but just had lived out their useful life. This is for a 2007 Chevrolet HHR. I usually don't balk to much at buying better wipers instead of buying the ones that cost like 4 dollars a piece. So I saw these and figured they'd be good as rain-x has a pretty good name.They were super easy to install, but that's more about how Chevrolet does their wiper arms than the blades themselves. The attachment point is a bit on the bulky side, but that shouldn't bother anyone. I installed the wipers, and after the first rain realized that they don't provide enough pressure towards the end of the blade to wipe water off the windshield. It's only a small area, and doesn't affect visibility, but these wipers cost quite a bit so I'd expect them to perform well.These wipers are in fact quiet however. And (except for the ends) they do a great job of getting the water off the windshield streak free.I can not recommend these wipers to anyone.  ",Overpriced

"  First of all, all of the reviewers that gave these a negative review before me are all nuts.

They are very sturdy, hug the windshield smoothly and evenly, and create a streak-free wipe every time, no matter how hard it rains. I have yet to test these in the winter, but with their frame-less design, I doubt these will under-preform. The only reasons I would believe some people don't like these are because those people are either cheap (These are about double the cost of regular blades, but are definitely worth it) or they don't use the Rain-X Windshield Treatment in addition to these. Like with Rain-X Washer Fluid, even though it doesn't mention this on the bottle, if you don't use the Rain-X Treatment along with it, it will make your windshield even dirtier after using it. It wasn't until I used the Rain-X Treatment along with the Washer Fluid until the product worked like a charm. The Rain-X Windshield Treatment does an awesome job at increasing visibility during showers, so it's a good thing to use anyways.

No big deal practically, but annoying.2) When driving fast on the freeway, there was one time, maybe because of heavy wind, the driver side wiper actually lifted - as in, not touching the glass.  This happened on one side.  When compared to the OEM blade, the OEM frame is a lot heavier, and has a contraption that seems like an airfoil.  Maybe this is why.

"  I'm comparing this to a     premium     Michelin wiper blade I had installed previously on my Civic, which I had purchased at the local Wal*Mart, and I think it holds up quite nicely. First of all, they both have a bracketless construction which prevents chunks of ice from getting stuck between the arms which would otherwise cause the wiper to become ineffective. Come blizzard time here in New England, that will be much appreciated.  This wiper installed more easily than the Michelin; the default mounting bracket worked perfectly and there was only one way--the correct way--to snap the blade onto my wiper arm. In addition, the mounting bracket is somewhat closed to the elements, and should prevent ice and other foreign objects from getting lodged there.So, I would characterize this wiper as well and thoughtfully constructed.[Update: wiper failed when the blade shredded after 2,5 years of service, pretty good as these things go.]As for the breast cancer awareness ribbon logo, it is clearly visible to the driver.

My dear sister is a breast cancer survivor, and the disease has cost me in emotional pain; maybe I don't want to be reminded of that pain every day on the way to work.  ",Underpriced

Does not work well on the rear window of my 2000 Subaru Forester.  Does not follow the curve of the rear window and the top of the arc does not contact the window.,Overpriced
"  A bit pricy but all around good value. Has been working streak free through New England winter and Texas summers. The silicone window treatment, like Rainx; means you only need to run wipers in the lightest mist and heaviest downpours. The rest just blows off while going at highway speeds. I expect these blades to last over a year under tough environmental conditions. Too bad the other wiper manufacturers quit marketing refills, but then I wouldn't have been tempted to make the switch.  ",Underpriced
"  Have to wait for rain, but as best I can tell a good oem replacement refill for the 2009 Mazda 6, s model, 6 Cly. This is the second generation Mazda 6, and I believe model changed again in 2014.Finding the right refill can be a challenge. Local pep boys does not stock refills and wants you to get complete wiper arm, Napa had generic refill but they lacked the metal strips. The metal strips are what gives the blade its spring, which in turns allows its to form fit to the glass.I measured my old ones, and they were 8mm. Just like these. As there are wide, narrow, extra narrow, best to measure first.For what it's worth, parts search returned these,     45-240 and 46-180     for driver/passenger respectively, they also listed the trico     17-240 and 17-180    . Not sure what those would have done and not clear what the difference is.Install tip: follow directions. ;)Seriously, they are picture based directions that have 3 steps so not hard. The metal strips can fall out easily. The new refill should have plastic clips that keeps everything together. Leave the clips on, and as you insert the new refill they will be pushed to the end and come off.  ",Underpriced
"  I bought 2 pairs of these for use with a Ford and a Mazda. Both have narrow wipers of appropriate length and are supposed to be compatible with this product.The refills are just a tiny bit too wide (not more than 0.5mm or 1mm too wide) and that makes them 100% unusable. On the Ford, where I was lucky and I managed to squeeze the refills in it took FOREVER to get it right (I spent almost 30 minutes on the first wiper and about 15 on the second)On the Mazda, I just couldn't get it done. I had to use pliers to slightly widen the gap on the little metal pieces that are supposed to hold the refill just to get it through and ended up destroying my blades.I cannot think of a single good thing to say about this item!do yourself a favor and buy a different product.

Best wipers you will ever buy. Mine have lasted on another one of my cars for almost two years. I should know living in the Pacfic Northwest with all the rain we get.,Underpriced
"  A perfect fit in the oem frames on my 08 Frontier.  Have been through several storms and I'm very glad I bought these, light rain at highway speeds I don't even need to turn on the wipers. I would buy again if needed.  ",Underpriced
Bought a pair of these for one of my cars.I was trying to cheap out by getting these refills.  Big mistake.Hard to install.  Too loose.  Falls out from the wiper frame/holder.I ended up buying the whole wiper blade assembly from Costco.,Overpriced
these are heavy duty extra wide wiper refills.  they will not fit in a standard car wiper blade.  this information should have been part of the description.,Overpriced
