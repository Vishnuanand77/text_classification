Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.\n",

      "Review:  It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting. \n",

I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! \n",

      "Review: You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.\n",

      "Review:  It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting. \n",

Yesterday, the battery on my car died, it was another brand from walmart it last 2 years and 10 months, i just went to the store WITHOUT receipt of purchase,and still got a new one for 2.06$ !!!! and still with 3 years of free replacement!! \n",

      "Review:  The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! \n",

      "Review: You will have to remove the window which is very easy and be very careful.  drop the window down to allow access to both screws holding the glass.  Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.\n",

      "Review:  It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting. \n",

      "Review:  The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! \n",

      "Review:  If quality matters to you, and you are looking for an authentic UB1250 battery by Universal Power Group, Inc. (UPG), then buyer beware of this listing.  I rcvd a   Sigma Tek   battery of unknown quality instead of a UB1250.  You can get knock-off brands (i.e. Sigmas Tek) cheaper elsewhere. I hope this meets Amazon's review criteria, since it is about the product I rcvd, just too bad it wasn't the same as advertised.  I would expect that from Ebay, but not Amazon. Can't warn you about the seller (Amazon won't let me here), but their name abbreviated is a good description of their Bait-and-Switch tactics. \n",

      "Review:  This battery does not have F2 terminals. They are F1, and two small converters change the F1 to F2. One converted quickly and easily, the other took some work and pliers. I would have prefered a battery with F2 terminals as this one was described, as I specifically did NOT order a battery with converters. Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.  But the battery fits and works well, just wish it was as described. \n",

He use to work on motorcycles, so he knows the procedures on how to install a battery in a motorcycle and how to charge them properly before installed in the bike.  So this battery was a dud. There was a no return policy, so I wasted my money. Would not recommend this product from this seller.  VERY VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. And this is the first time I have EVER given a bad review.

      "Review:  I was a bit worried about ordering a battery from Amazon especially after the poor review and date problem listed below but, our travel trailer battery was dead and after checking local prices (whew!) decided to give this a try.After reading all the reviews, opted for this one and then noticed, WarehouseDeals had one available for a few bucks less. Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was   uh-oh   because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh! Oh - it was dirty as all get-out but I saved about $100 so still very pleased! \n",

      "Review:  My low battery alarm started going off in the middle of the night, and then proceeded to do it every night until I replaced it. Very  Annoying!For some reason, I failed to select expedited shipping, but that wasn't a problem because the vendor shipped it the next day. Since I live in the same state, I got it the day after that. This alone warranted the 5 star rating for me as I couldn't get the battery warning to stop. The manual failed me.The battery arrived as an exact match of the original; exactly as pictured. The original battery lasted almost 13 years. Hopefully this will last as long too.After installation, my system did not immediately clear the Low Battery warning. It didn't continue to alarm, but did still show it on the consoles. This worried me at first. Sometime during the night, the system apparently did a battery check and noticed that it was fine.The battery was packaged well for shipping. Box just large enough. Enough, but not too much, bubble wrap with just a single piece of tape to cut to get at the new battery. No packaging wounds from this product/company. \n",

Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.\n",

      "Review:  It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting. \n",

      "Review:  The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! \n",

I rcvd a   Sigma Tek   battery of unknown quality instead of a UB1250.  You can get knock-off brands (i.e. Sigmas Tek) cheaper elsewhere. I hope this meets Amazon's review criteria, since it is about the product I rcvd, just too bad it wasn't the same as advertised.  I would expect that from Ebay, but not Amazon. Can't warn you about the seller (Amazon won't let me here), but their name abbreviated is a good description of their Bait-and-Switch tactics. \n",

I would have prefered a battery with F2 terminals as this one was described, as I specifically did NOT order a battery with converters. Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.

He use to work on motorcycles, so he knows the procedures on how to install a battery in a motorcycle and how to charge them properly before installed in the bike.  So this battery was a dud. There was a no return policy, so I wasted my money. Would not recommend this product from this seller.  VERY VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. And this is the first time I have EVER given a bad review.

      "Review:  I was a bit worried about ordering a battery from Amazon especially after the poor review and date problem listed below but, our travel trailer battery was dead and after checking local prices (whew!) decided to give this a try.After reading all the reviews, opted for this one and then noticed, WarehouseDeals had one available for a few bucks less. Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was   uh-oh   because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh! Oh - it was dirty as all get-out but I saved about $100 so still very pleased! \n",

Very  Annoying!For some reason, I failed to select expedited shipping, but that wasn't a problem because the vendor shipped it the next day. Since I live in the same state, I got it the day after that. This alone warranted the 5 star rating for me as I couldn't get the battery warning to stop.

The battery lasted a total of approximately 5-1/2 hours and 5-1/2 miles before losing most of its power. Most of the setting ran on the trolling motor was 1 and 2 from 5 selections (5 being highest output) We did encounter some head winds for some of this time.  I emailed my findings to VMAX and they replied back promptly that the conditions I gave them and the life of the battery was about what was to be expected.  Personally I think I was expecting a little more battery life.  Now that I know what to expect I can better judge how close I should be to the boat ramp before losing power!  Rowing blows....

      "Review:  UPDATE 2/05/12 - Amazon is allowing me to return all six reels I bought with them paying postage, even though I bought them nearly a year ago. I have no need for spools of fake copper wire made out of 95% aluminum.UPDATE 2/03/12 - just today I became aware of the review by Kyle A. Stein, to see it click on the reviews of the black color of this same wire, BC4B-100.  He reports that it only has a trace of copper and it's mostly aluminum. I will be contacting Amazon about possible fraud.________________________________________________  now back to original review from early 2011:I just took delivery on a spool of this in black and a spool of it in red, and I'll describe it here... but first, I'd like to ask anyone out there if this is really copper wire.IS IT?Amazon is a nice buying experience usually, but in some cases - like this - there is no way to get a quick answer to a question, I don't know if I should return it or not.The wire is silvery-color instead of copper-color.  Now this could be because it's plated in silver or tin, which would be ok, or it could be that it's steel wire, which would not be OK.  Wish me luck in figuring that out.  The description claims it to be copper wire, but it is not copper color.It is also not what one usually thinks of as battery cable, which is that fairly-rigid stuff that battery cables are made out of. This has much finer strands, and to my eye looks a lot narrower in the total strands than 4 gauge battery cable.It is limp as a noodle, also unlike normal battery cable, and I assume it is more for installing stereo systems than being used as robust battery cable.Any recommendations out there for how I can tell? I think I'll probably be returning it, because it simply isn't regular battery cable wire.  But I might keep it IF it turns out to be copper wire. \n",

      "Review:  As my Amazon name indicates, I am not an auto technician. Mechanics, however, has been one of my hobbies since I was a teenager. I have owned a number of different used cars over the years, and several of them when purchased had terminals which were crusty to the point of being irreparable. Once I installed new cables, I sprayed their metal ends with this product occasionally and never had any problems with buildup again. It also works well for coating wherever the negative cable connects to the frame on an older truck or full framed car.  Since it's not something I use very often (one coating usually lasts a year or so, and I live in a very dry climate), one can lasts me quite awhile. The can I am using now may only be the second one I ever purchased. \n",

      "Review:  Last week driving my Nissan Quest the kids left some lights on and the battery died.  Lucky for me a friend had a portable battery charger.  It was about 3 degrees outside so I was really lucky.  That got me thinking that I really needed to get one.  After some research I decided to go with the JNC300XL.  It had the most reviews and for the price I seemed like a good deal to me.  I received this on Wednesday 1/22/14.  I was sick so I was unable to charge it until afternoon of 1/23/14.  It charged for about 18 hours, then Friday 1/24/14 (today) my wife woke me up.  Said the battery was dead in the other van.  I checked the charge indicator on this unit and it was 3/4.  I hooked it up to the van and bam was able to start the van right up.  I know people are not 100% sure how to hook up the jumper cables.  I've 100% of the time hook up the red (+)  and the black (-) to the battery terminals.  I don't ground the black to the car, and 100% of the time I'm able to crank over the car.  I've never had an issue with sparking etc.  I've helped my friends and I show up and I see how they have the jumper cables hooked up and they are having a hard time jumping their own car, and I have them shut everything off, then hook up the cables directly, and bam jump the car.  Take it for what it's worth.Pros:- didn't take long to charge the internal battery before jumping my car- light weight- AC adapter to charge the battery easy to use (some require you to use a extension cord)- Design (like the way they give you a nice safe way to clamp your cords to the pack. Helps with them to not accidently touch and helps prevent any foreseeable fire damage by crossing.Cons:Non yet I've only owned this unit for 3 days. \n",

      "Review:  I have bought a couple of department store booster packs in the past and they never seem to last more than 2-3 years. I decided to do a little research and invest in a high quality one. I found this one on amazon and I love it. It is very durable, holds a charge for a ridiculously long time and can provide multiple boosts on a single charge. I wish I had found this sooner instead of wasting money on the cheap department store ones I had in the past.One thing to note is that It doesn't have built in reverse polarity protection so make sure you connect the leads to the right battery terminal (eg. positive to positive). It sounds like a no-brainer, but I was I wasn't paying attention one night and connected them in reverse and blew the main fuse on a vehicle that I was boosting. So the car had to sit there till the next day when I could come back with a new fuse. Oops! Needless to say I pay more attention when I connect this starter now. I think I prefer it without the idiot-proof reverse polarity protection.  Keep it simple and avoid additional electronics.This thing has been extremely useful for me, and provides peace of mind in the cold winter mornings.

It has only jump started a car once.I took it apart to see if the problem was something obvious (I am an electrical engineer) but other than some bad solder joints nothing was apparent.

You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;.

If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.

I started comparing prices and shopped the usual stores online like Autozone, Advance Auto and Pep Boys, only to discover that the aftermarket items had no rain shield or bracket, and instructions on Youtube indicated you'd need to take the bracket off of your old one and transfer it to the new part, however I'd discovered mine was missing, so there was no old part to rob the necessary parts from.  That's when I started searching for the factory OEM replacement part in hopes that it would be complete.  As usual I shopped around for the best deal and after finding the correct part number I did a more specific search.  Amazon's price was far below both the aftermarket and OEM part I found elsewhere, and it also had the rain shield.

I replaced the temp door actuator and... still stuck on hot... bummed me out but I did some more research which lead me to to do the following.  With the ignition key off I unplugged the AC/Heater programmer module (its located behind the glove box with a couple of big wire harness connectors plugged into it, access it by lowering the black panel underneath the glove box) and let it power down for a couple of minutes. With the key still off I reconnected both connectors, then turned the key to on for 3 minutes, without starting the engine. This process clears any codes that were stored in the module and forces it to go through a door position   learn   test, which properly activated the actuator and now my dual zone climate controls are functioning normally once again!  Wish I'd known about the relearn procedure before I started, might have saved me the cost of an actuator... but it did quit working properly for some reason, and it may have only delayed my purchase a few days before it failed again.

      "Predicted Label: Correct Size/\n",
      "Review:  There is a known problem on some Government Motors (GM) products, including Chevy Silverado trucks, of the ABS falsely activating at low speeds while decelerating from approximately 7 to 3 mph. Although this is not a major safety hazard making the truck undriveable, it is extremely annoying, almost as annoying as the costly GM bailout, LOL! Fortunately it is easy to correct without spending billions of taxpayer dollars. It is caused by an error in the front wheel speed sensors.These ACDelco sensors are the exact OEM item, and Amazon actually sells them for a lower price than some aftermarket substitutes. Replacement, while not a 15-minute breeze, is a pretty basic operation using the usual automotive tools. With the vehicle jacked up on safety stands and the front wheel removed, follow the normal procedure to remove the caliper, and then remove the rotor. The sensor is held into the hub with one Allen screw, and there is one electrical plug to disconnect, and then it's out.It is absolutely essential to be sure the mating surface on the bearing hub is immaculately cleared of any rust, using sandpaper, Scotchbrite or wire brush. Even a very thin layer of rust can prevent the sensor from seating properly and cause errors. Be sure the mounting hole is free of sanding debris. Spraying a light coat of rust preventive paint on the cleaned surface may help prevent the rust from re-appearing. Put it all back together, and then you'll have smooth stops and can quit cringing when you step on the brake pedal.The vehicle's OBD-II system may have stored a code relating to this error even after the repair. This can be cleared using a Scantool. If you don't have one, you can buy it from Amazon. \n",

      "Review:  ABS Code checks at my local Autozone narrowed my problem down to my left rear hub. The rear hubs on this 2002 Buick Lesabre have the speed sensors built into the hubs and it is the rotation of the speed sensor which provides feedback to the ABS controller. There are a number of conditions which can trigger an ABS code and in my case there was a fluctuation in the DC voltage going to the left rear wheel sensor. A quick way of checking the voltage at the sensor connector is to measure the voltage at both female connections in the harness which plugs into the sensor. If the vehicle has the original speed sensor connections, one wire will be black and one wire will be white. The DC voltage on the white wire side should be less than 4.0 V DC and the black wire may show just a trace amount of voltage less than about 0.04 mV DC. I had a steady 4.0 V DC on the right side hub, but the left side kept fluctuating between 2.0 and 4.0 V DC. Initially, I thought I had a bad speed sensor in my new left hub, so I replaced the hub under warranty. Nothing lost, since I can now change out a hub in 30 minutes or less! Thinking I had a bad Delphi connector, which after several hours of searching in the Delphi catalog ended up being Connector Body P/N 12052638, Connector Seal P/N 12048086, Terminal P/N 12048074, Lock P/N 12052634, and some 20 AWG black and white multistrand wire, I ended up soldering and crimping a replacement pigtail connector which actually fit the connector mounted on the wheel hub. I spliced in my replacement pigtail and hoped the ABS light would go off. After a short test dive to get over 5 MPH, I heard the familiar 'ding' of the ABS light coming on and I thought it was best to replace the enter wheel speed sensor assembly. Initially, I was going to pull out the existing wheel speed sensor wiring harness but since GM had mounted this wiring harness to the vehicle frame before they attached the body, I simply cut the old harness ends off and ran the new wiring harness alongside the existing wiring harness using wire ties to keep the new harness in place along the vehicle frame. I plugged in the new harness to the wheel sensors, took the car for a spin, and no more ABS or Traction control light. After dissecting the old wiring harness to get to the root cause of my intermittent voltage, I found that a previous vehicle owner had spliced in about a 6 inch section of larger gage wire into the white wire which was going to the left rear speed sensor. This additional resistance was enough to affect the voltage at the sensor which triggered the ABS code. This larger wire was spliced in about 10 inches beyond where I had made my splice joint and if I had found it earlier during an inspection of the wiring harness, my custom made pigtail would have fixed the problem. In the end the $90 I paid for a replacement wiring harness was worth the money since I have now learned so much about wheel hubs, ABS sensors, wiring harnesses, and Delphi connectors. \n",

      "Review:  This fits my 2004 E-320 wagon, rear wheels. My car only has one sensor (Passenger side) and these pads do NOT come with sensors. The pads are right and left, so fit your sensor before you begin to be sure you have them installed on the correct sides.  Mine usedBeck Arnley 084-1526 Disc Brake Pad Electronic Wear Sensorlocated on the passenger rear. This sensor also fits driver front.Use 17 MM to remove wheel, and T-40 to loosen top and bottom bolts on caliper. Slide the bolts to the out position but do not remove. Pull caliper to you slowly to push piston back to release.CAUTION: It may require that you have a computer hooked up to the system before you compress the piston.  If you can install without compressing, you would not need to hook it up. Otherwise, you may damage the ABS system by not deactivating the system using the computer (something to do with pressure).  4 star instead of 5 because you need to buy sensors separately. \n",

The shoes (4) are loose in the box so that they bang against each other until the customer receives them. Two of the four shoes I received were damaged. Haven't decided it I'm going to return them yet as the damage may not be a big enough problem. Essentially, the damage amounts to a corner of one of the shoe pads that had been hit and broken off (about the size of a penny) and another shoe pad had been that had been nicked pretty hard on one edge.The main fault lies with the manufacturer in that they should secure the shoes so that they can't bang against each other in shipment, but Amazon didn't do much either in that the brake shoe box was loose inside the bigger Amazon box (the lone air pillow inside was flat, should have been several more).I had also purchased some disk brake pads from the same manufacturer in a separate order which, though packaged the same way, managed to make the trip without any real damage.I gave the product 4 stars only because the shoes are supposed to be good.

If you are a machinist this is laughable for accuracy.For carpentry it's ok, and for measuring body parts it's good since 1mm is as close as you are going to get anyway.This set should cost about 2 bucks not more than double that, like I paid.That's why I rated it 3 stars. \n",

      "Review:  I'm going to purchase this tool because I needed it yesterday. I've never had to deal with these type of brake calipers in the past and was at a loss when my C-clamp wouldn't compress the caliper in. My local Hyundai dealer called me about my other vehicle that was in the shop for more serious repair when I told him I was working on my other Hyundai and couldn't get the rear calipers compressed. He was happy to tell me how to use a pair of needle nose pliers to help screw them in. I will say it was so difficult to keep the pliers spread apart to fit the slots and I kept loosing my grip. It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in.

It survived the winter here in Upstate NY and was sitting by the pond all Spring. That frog left on the 4th of July and now two little ones have moved in. I painted the waterfall a silvery color and over the winter (I left it out not knowing where the frog was hibernating) it weathered to a nice natural look.It was very easy to put in  and the pump continues to work with no problems other than an easy cleaning which was described in the literature that came with the kit. I highly recommend this product for a small yard .It was shipped very, very quickly by Northern tool and was packaged extremely well. 5 stars all around for this pond. \n",

New bolts, copper washers, and clips.Cons - Hoses don't have an outer protective casing like some higher end hoses.  The kit says the hoses are slightly longer than stock to allow you to run the hoses where you want which lets the hose rub against the upper arm.Overall I would buy these hoses again for my application.  However if your project is for more show than go, skip these and go for a little more money for a set of coated hoses. \n",

      "Review:  I purchased both the large and small universal adapters in order to bleed my S2000s brake and clutch master cylinders.  At first look after I initially received both items - I thought there was a mistake due to the fact they looked to be the same size.  I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder. \n",

      "Review:  Overall, this kit worked for my 2004 Toyota Sequoia. All of the springs and hold-down parts seemed to be an exact match of what I had on my car. However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are. \n",

At 1st glance the diameter is correct but the bolt pattern was wrong. The product may be just great but if they don't fit I can't judge. So my review gives 3 stars because they are the wrong size. Of course I had the truck pulled apart before I noticed. Then I had to run into town and buy the correct rotors from the local NAPA store at 5PM on a Saturday. I read online that the Ford caliper pins don't   float   well so the rotors don't get even wear. One blog site said the NAPA pins are better and correct this issue so I ordered those from NAPA and installed. Getting the rotor off was also a challenge.

      "Review:  My  #34;Check Engine #34; light has been on for a while on my car.  I purchased this cap as one of the possible solutions since a failed seal inside the gas cap can be one of the causes for the light.One of the reasons for choosing this cap is the fact that it is the standard Motorcraft quality guarantee.  Motorcraft is the original manufacturer and, therefore, I will have a guarantee that it will fit.The other main reason why I chose this cap is the fact that it has a tether, just like the original, to ensure that I don't lose, drop on the ground or ruin in other manner the new cap.When it arrived, it took 2 minutes to unscrew the tether on the old one and replace it with the new one.I'm extremely happy with the purchase. \n",

      "Review:  Like other's have stated, this Stant #10504Y (Yellow) locking Gas Cap did not come up as compatible with my vehicle, but the Stant #10504 (Black) Gas Cap did show compatible.  I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.  So I ordered the yellow cap as my Terrain came with an original Yellow Gas cap since it can use E-85.  I have never put E-85 in my vehicle, but wanted to keep things a near as original as possible.  I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase. \n",

      "Review:  As far as overflow bottle caps go, this one is one of the better built in a sea of copycat units.  Mine was built in Germany, but your mileage may vary.  The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted! \n",

      "Review:  Back in October of 2012 I knocked out my ambient temp sensor on my '00 528i while driving over a piece of tire on the highway on my way to work, and although I did not know what had happened that morning I figured it out on my way home that same day when the heat really kicked in and my A/C did not work.  Needless to say I was skeptical about buying this item as with most things I suppose, you really need to just stop overthinking things and decide what you want to do.  After seeing several reviews and posts on internet forums I decided to purchase this as the Texas heat was really beginning to take its toll on me.  I am the type of person that will not even change my own oil, I'll take it to the shop but usually by the time I get off work every shop is closed and besides I figured I had to get my hands dirty at some point.  I went back and looked at the forums one last time, went outside armed with only a pair of wire cutters, my socket set to disconnect the battery lead as I wasn #8217;t sure what kind of damage I was potentially looking at from my lack of experience and electrical tape of course.  Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.  This was probably as hands on as I have gotten other than replacing my own headlights not too long ago, and this is enough for a while.  A product that is packaged and includes all items as advertised, does what it is supposed to do, and relatively easy to install even for a person with no experience.  AWESOME! \n",

      "Review:  I had the same issue as another reviewer...  2003 Trailblazer LS HVAC vents not working for the front vents / no air flow but worked for defrost and lower.  I also had a battery failure and never linked these two issues but in hindsight it appeared to caused the vent problem.  After reading about some horror stories of dealers charging 4-5 hrs and $150+ for the part it seemed worth trying to fix myself and good news is it's actually a pretty easy fix.Remove the driver side lower plastic dash cover by the pedals, pop off the lower vent duct (one christmas tree type snap) and then you have access.  There's two actuators and for a front vent issue the bad actuator is the lower of the two, the one closer to the driver seat.  Of course I pulled the wrong one off first and learned it controls the defrost/floor airflow and it doesn't have that white gear part shown on the picture but otherwise looks the same. \n",

That means there was a vacuum inside of it, and this is what you want. If you don't hear that sucking sound, moisture may have made its way into the unit, permanently destroying the desiccant inside. Pulling a vacuum on your system will not reverse this because the desiccant has undergone a chemical reaction.

      "Review:  As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with any mounting bolts, and the ones that come out of the compressor are about 4 inches too long, for this part. That leaves you having to go find replacement bolts, hopefully at your local hardware or auto store. It would be nice if they included some notes, indicating which size bolts you need, instead of trying to take the stock compressor bolts and match them up, to what you think will be the right length.The other issue is with the power steering pump, filler neck. In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket. Not sure why this was never accounted for, when this part was made. \n",

I did not install the in helmet speakers, preferring to use some in ear headphones. My brother had some in helmet speakers already installed and I would assume their performance would be similar to the ones provided by Cardo. He was very pleased with the sound quality and said he could hear me perfectly. I noticed that his battery lasted a bit longer than mine and I think that can be attributed to the drivers in my in ear headphones versus his in helmet speakers.

The retaining bolts that hold them were a challenge these are on the backing plate (nothing to do with the new bearings). Make sure you put WD-40 or something like it on the center bolts and the nuts that hold the plate. Made a difference on the car's handling, much tighter (96k on Buick Park Ave). Oh yes, and make sure you tighten the center nut (this one must be really tight). You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;. I tried to buy them locally, and no one has them in stock, you get a new one if you order the whole hub assembly. These bearings from Timkin are the way to go, spend the extra for these so hopefully you don't get to do it again anytime soon.If you don't have a lift rack (I don't) figure about 2 hours a side.

If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.

It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in. Not sure why I had to screw them OUT to get them IN but it worked. Anyway, after dealing with that I decided that I will be purchasing a tool next time to make it easier and I think this tool will do the trick. I don't really care if it's precision made like another commenter said it needed to be. Hey, as long as it makes it easy to wind them back in right? If my needle nose pliers can get them in why wouldn't these tools?Here is what my caliper looks like [...] \n",

It survived the winter here in Upstate NY and was sitting by the pond all Spring. That frog left on the 4th of July and now two little ones have moved in. I painted the waterfall a silvery color and over the winter (I left it out not knowing where the frog was hibernating) it weathered to a nice natural look.It was very easy to put in  and the pump continues to work with no problems other than an easy cleaning which was described in the literature that came with the kit.

The kit says the hoses are slightly longer than stock to allow you to run the hoses where you want which lets the hose rub against the upper arm.Overall I would buy these hoses again for my application.

      "Review:  I purchased both the large and small universal adapters in order to bleed my S2000s brake and clutch master cylinders.  At first look after I initially received both items - I thought there was a mistake due to the fact they looked to be the same size.  I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder. \n",

      "Review:  Overall, this kit worked for my 2004 Toyota Sequoia. All of the springs and hold-down parts seemed to be an exact match of what I had on my car. However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are. \n",

I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.

I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase. \n",

The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted! \n",

      "Review:  Back in October of 2012 I knocked out my ambient temp sensor on my '00 528i while driving over a piece of tire on the highway on my way to work, and although I did not know what had happened that morning I figured it out on my way home that same day when the heat really kicked in and my A/C did not work.

I went back and looked at the forums one last time, went outside armed with only a pair of wire cutters, my socket set to disconnect the battery lead as I wasn #8217;t sure what kind of damage I was potentially looking at from my lack of experience and electrical tape of course.  Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.  This was probably as hands on as I have gotten other than replacing my own headlights not too long ago, and this is enough for a while.

It would be nice if they included some notes, indicating which size bolts you need, instead of trying to take the stock compressor bolts and match them up, to what you think will be the right length.The other issue is with the power steering pump, filler neck. In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket.

      "Review:  Installation was relatively easy, especially considering I am not a   car guy   at all. It took me about an hour but, again, I have no experience working on engines, etc. other than to change the oil and simple maintenance-type jobs. Even a semi-experienced person could probably have the old intake out and the new one installed in about 20 minutes. With a small socket set, a screwdriver and/or a cordless drill, this can be done with little or no problems. The one suggestion I would make to people installing this (or if I had it to do over again) is that I would go ahead and attach the breather hose to the Volant vent BEFORE the vent is installed, as it is a very snug fit and can be a little awkward to fit on once the vent is installed. Everything else was a piece of cake.I read some reviews that the Volant instructions weren't very good but I found them to be very clear and concise (although, b/c of my ignorance, I had to search online to make sure I was unscrewing the MAF sensor and not something else)...Packaging and shipping were great (I got mine in 2 days for free with my Amazon Prime membership).Now, the results...it definitely makes acceleration a little   throatier   than before but it's not obnoxious. I was worried that my truck might sound like a Harley with the new intake but that's not the case. It is a bit louder at the top end of acceleration than I planned for but, even still, not obnoxious. It sounds tough. My truck now has a noticeable increase in acceleration, which is what I bought it for. It's too early to tell the impact, if any, on gas mileage but I've read and heard consistently that it will give you an extra 1-1/2-3 MPG increase, which is always nice. Would definitely recommend. \n",

What I received was a mount with the same model number but, had a different manufacturers label and no mention of Anchor brand.  After initially panicking, I was scheduled to install the next day, I contacted Anchor and confirmed that these were indeed rebranded Anchor motor mounts.  As for the quality, fit and finish - The fit was good and they installed with little difficulty.  The quality appeared to be similar to the original equipment although, I noticed some defects in the paint which already had signs of rust.  Not perfect but, I received them quickly due to Prime and saved a ton of $ over the cost of the Honda original equipment replacement.  I replaced the passenger side mount at the same time and my review for that mount is exactly the same as this.  Tip: If you decide to DIY the motor mounts on your Pilot / Ridgeline or Passport, make sure you are prepared to replace all of the small plastic molding clips that hold on the splash shield under the front bumper.  The small ones are brittle and are not designed to be removed and reinstalled.  order a pack of these: http://www.amazon.com/Push-type-Fastener-91503-SZ3-003-Element-Ridgeline/dp/B00842A7F4/ref=sr_1_3?s=automotive ie=UTF8 qid=1395075816 sr=1-3 keywords=91512-sx0-003.  You'll only need about 14 or so but, they are cheaper in bulk.  There are 3 or 4 larger clips which you might be able to carefully removed without breaking but, mine were brittle and I cracked a couple of them.  The Honda part number is 91503-sz5-003.

      "Review:  Chrome Valve Cover - The Amazon site stated that the Chrome Valve Cover would fit my 225 slant six engine.  It fits, but is not a stock application.  This valve cover only has two holes, the stock valve cover has three holes...1 for the oil cap, 1 for the breather cap, and 1 for the pcv valve.  If I use the chrome valve cover I cannot use the stock breather cap, and must use an after market push-on cap in order to have an access hole to put in oil.  Using this type of breather cap reqiuires either plugging the line from the air cleaner or purchasing an after-market custom air cleaner that also won't support the stock fresh air intake.  Unless you are willing to make several custom alterations, I suggest staying with a stock valve cover.  One other thing, the two holes in the chrome valve cover aren't the same size as the ones in the stock valve cover, so plan to buy new grommets also. \n",

It was three bolts on either side of the block, the hangar bolt, and then the two spring bolts in the rear which broke due to rust so for $11 just get them ahead of time just in case.

      "Review:  ThisTYC Cabin Air Filter for Nissan Pathfinder (2005-2008)seems to be an adequate substitute for the OEM filter, and considerably cheaper. A set of two (required) was only $16.99. However, it apparently is made slightly wider than necessary, and therefore is a royal pain to fit into the filter cavity in the AC system.The first filter slides in pretty easily. Once in, it must be slid to the right beyond the cavity opening in order to insert the second filter . . . far easier said than done due to its slightly oversized dimensions. The filter must be mashed a bit, which deforms its edges. I suspect that creates air flow gaps between the two filters. I say   suspect,   because once the filters are inserted, they can't be seen. The OEM filters I removed were somewhat deformed as well, so perhaps this isn't a relevant issue.My only other concern is that, compared to the OEM filter, this one appears to have 20-30% fewer pleats. Although that likely permits freer air flow, it also probably filters less effectively. \n",

      "Review:  Bought this filter before reading the commentary on the web.  Had always thought Fram was a reliable brand made by a division of the Honeywell Corporation, but numerous questions raised by bloggers.  Turns out Honeywell sold the division to an Australian company in 2011, and the quality does seem questionable.  After splitting off the can top from the filter base, I found the filter media to have the manufacturing flaws noted in the blogs.  There was a large gap where the paper media was supposed to be joined around the steel core, and the end-caps were indeed made of loose-fitting cardboard.  Now more curious, I bought another model number at a local auto parts (PH3569) and opened it.  This filter was very well made with a tight, dense, even fitting media and steel end-caps.  If you use a lot of filters and can get a good price on Fram, you might open and examine the type you use to see if it's the better quality.  Hopefully, Fram is making the effort to improve all the types, regardless of where they are manufactured/sourced. \n",

At the back of each socket is a square base that fits up into a small rubber handle.  You push the end you are not going to use up inside of this rubber handle and the square base fits in so when you turn the handle the tool turns.  This square base barely fits into the handle and is loose and kept falling out.  Right when you are concentrating on how many turns you find you are not turning the tool at all because this tool has fallen out of the handle.  It only falls out far enough to stop turning.  the tool but if you don't see this and keep turning the handle, as the very end of the tool stays in but with not grip so you are turning nothing but the handle.  I finally discarded the handle and just used my fingers to turn the square base, or knob, that is attached to the socket.  The shaft is a flex cable, which makes it nice for tight places or reverse work like I had to do, as this was a motorhome so I had to work on the adjustments from the rear of the carb.  It worked but the handle was a joke.  I could have used some electrician tape and solved the problem.

I have heard of others taking a piece of steel brake line (thin walled metal tubing) and flattening one end just enough to slip over the mixture screw, and the tubing being just small enough in dia. to fit into the recess.

      "Review:  I don't know how much more involved pulling the fuel pump from the original housing would have been, but replacing the entire housing with the fuel pump already installed sure did make this an easy 'pull-and-drop' installation. ** UPDATE: See below **The reason I changed the entire housing is because I have an 04 Sentra SE-R Spec V and there was a Nissan service bulletin (NTB05-052a) which was a fuel-pump repair kit. The repair kit itself was over $200 from the dealer, plus my fuel pump was not maintaining adequate pressure, so not only was this easier to install, but also saved me quite a bit of money as well.I didn't want to install the Nissan-branded fuel pump because it is known to have issues and need replacing every ~60K miles. I went with Bosch for ease of installation and company reputation.I recommend this kit if you have an 04-06 Sentra and have been plagued with any kind of hard-starting issue and/or fuel pressure issue that might be observed by a drop in engine RPMs.** UPDATE: you will have to do a bit of wiring since the new fuel pump housing does NOT include the Fuel Temperature Sensor, although it is shown in the picture (at the very bottom of the fuel pump housing (Blue and Black wires). The housing comes bare and also with no instructions! It's definitely misleading since the picture clearly shows the Temperature sensor in-place. If you're getting the P0183 after installation, this is your issue. Transfer the Fuel Temp Sensor over from your old Fuel Pump housing and your code should be cleared and not return. I threw my old housing away too soon and had to pick up the part from the Junk Yard-- 35 miles away! Hard lesson learned.*** 2nd UPDATE: I contacted Bosch AutoPart Customer Service and was able to talk with a Bosch parts specialist: The Bosch 69701 Electric Fuel pump does NOT have support for CA emissions, hence the lack of Fuel Tank Temp Sensor. The 69701 is only made for Federal Emissions vehicles. Therefore Bosch does not supply the Fuel Tank Temperature Sensor and 69701 is actually not compatible with my 04 Sentra SE-R Spec V. \n",

The only issue I ran into with installation was the o-ring that seals the pump to the fuel tank was the wrong size, so I just used my old one. That is not actually the first time I have seen this problem. I worked at an auto parts store for 16 years and have seen this with multiple brands. I sold Delphi for many years.

I purchased an adjustable oil filter wrench that look like channel locks to unscrew the unit from the top of the tank.  Make sure to get the o-ring in place along with the gasket to prevent leakage.  And make sure the old o-ring is on the old pump and not still on the gas tank or it's going to be impossible to press the new pump into place.

Being an inline pump, installation is as easy as it gets, and I also installed an inline filter just before this pump. My first test drive was a let down because the engine hesitated and cut out several times over the course of 20 minutes. Back at home, I pulled the fuel line and found that the pump was only dribbling gas. I replaced it with a Carter pump and all is good now. It could be that I received a defective pump, not sure, but I wasn't taking any chances with a replacement Delco.Also, the pump photo on Amazon is not correct. The EP12S has one 3/8   nipple on each end and has + and - leads for hookup. \n",

      "Review:  This was an exact replacement fuel pump for my wife's 2005 Ford Five Hundred.  Relatively easy installation as Ford provided an access panel under the back seat.  Much easier than removing the fuel tank as is required on many of the modern fuel injected cars with the fuel pumps located within the fuel tank.  I also replaced the fuel pressure sending unit which is located on the   fuel rail   to the fuel injectors.  I'm not positive which one of these parts addressed the intermittent stalling and refusal to restart.  My wife is handicapped so didn't want to gamble on stranding her another time.  Based on the number of fuel pressure senders stocked by the local Ford Dealer for this car, I'm suspecting that was the culprit but glad to have both major pieces of the fuel delivery system replaced.

Before I purchased this BCM, I checked the part number with the auto dealer to make sure it was a direct replacement for my original BCM ... and it was.  So I purchased it.  I took it to an authorized Saturn Service Center to program and install it.  After 1-1/2 hours, the service technicians gave up.  This BCM could not be programmed.  It would not communicate with the programming equipment.  The problem wasn't with the Service Center's programming equipment because my old BCM connected to it just fine so they can download the vehicle VIN number and mileage to be transferred to the new BCM.  The worst part is that I still had to pay the $89 programming fee ... the Service Center did try to program it ... it wasn't their fault that the BCM was bad.  So I'm returning this BCM and contemplating on getting another one from Amazon or just buying one from the parts department.

      "Review:  I received this antenna as a gift, so I didn't personally purchase this through Amazon.Installation is really easy after you do all the necessary cleaning and prep (alcohol wipe down to remove the wax).1. Just unscrew the original antenna off the mount.2. Tape the alignment guide on your car.3. Attach the helix wire with the provided screw.4. Remove the cover of the 3M double sided tape and place the shark fin (Beat-Sonic calls it a Dolphin antenna) cover down over the factory antenna base and between the cutout in the alignment guide and press down to make the cover stick on your roof.Simple as that.  It took me about 10 minutes.It's painted to match the original color of your car so the installation looks factory and cool.  But.......you do lose some antenna gain.  I tuned onto popular local AM stations (for those of you in the Los Angeles area, the stations I used were KNX 1070 and 790 KABC) during installation.  When I made the connection as described in step 3 above, the radio reception was just as good as the factory antenna.  This was a dry test fit, so I didn't remove the cover of the double sided tape.  As I was lowering the fin cover over the factory base (step 4) I started to lose the signal (more static).  I removed my hand just to make sure my body wasn't blocking any of the signal, but no improvement.  I lifted the fin cover off and the signal came back.  Bottom line, the shark fin cover is not totally RF transparent and you are going to lose signal.If you live in a major city, this may not be an issue.  If you're far from the city and constantly struggling to get an AM signal, then I would not recommend this antenna.If I were to rate this on a scale from 1 to 10: Installation - 10; cool factor - 10; Performance - 7 \n",

It started at first with the only the right and then switched to the left blinker.  This is a pretty easy fix.  It is located on the back side of the fuse block underneath the steering wheel.  You have to remove the trim around the speedometer and then remove the plastic panel under the steering wheel.  It will be on the left hand side.  I had to unclip the fuse block to move it forward a bit to get enough wiggle room to remove the old flasher module. It is in pretty snug but with enough wiggling it does come out. The original flasher has a different part number, but I think this is a very common problem and this part works perfect and seems to be the new replacement part. \n",

      "Review:  2/23/11 - Update: Well, we recently used this in very bright sunlight, with the GPS placed on the dashboard. Unfortunately, the sunlight totally washed out the GPS screen, and since the angle of the mount is not adjustable, there wasn't anything I could do to make the screen easier to see. Had to keep the GPS balanced in the cupholder. It would have been great to have a few different angle adjustments to minimize this problem. I've dropped my rating down to 3 stars.___Original review - In California, until recently it was illegal to mount a GPS (or anything else) on the windshield. That meant that you either needed to affix a GPS mount to the dashboard, possibly marring the surface over time, or deal with the slipping and sliding of a loose unit as you drove. I was in the latter camp, and ended up putting the GPS in the cup holder more often than not, occasionally picking it up to make sure I was heading in the right direction.I actually spent quite a bit of time looking for solutions to this problem. Believe it or not, no one seemed to make a non-adhesive GPS mount for the dashboard. I tried a beanbag for a while, but this was obviously not the best solution (people gave me funny looks when they saw a Beanie Baby on my dashboard).This mount by Heininger is exactly what I was looking for. It is a molded soft foam/latex frame which has a grippy bottom to keep everything in place on your dashboard, an angled design to keep the GPS at a good viewing angle, and an open back in case you have cords to attach to the GPS. Most importantly, once you get to your destination you can just throw the mount on the floor so that no one knows you have a GPS unit in your car.The only significant downside is that since there is technically nothing that is keeping your GPS unit in place except gravity, sudden turns or stops/starts can potentially cause the GPS unit to tumble out of the mount. As long as that doesn't fit your driving style, this mount should work well for you. Also, it is somewhat on the large side, which allows a widescreen GPS to fit nicely in it, but it may be too big for some smaller units, such as the TomTom One. \n",

      "Review:  I don't know how you make such a great product that is mostly unusable unless you know how to splice electrical wiring.  I took this out of the package and visually inspected it, and thought, wow this is really built well.  I inserted a lighter type plug into it and it locked in like it would never let go.  I looked at the length and thought, well, it seems OK to me for my little Honda CBR500R.  Now the mistake I made was thinking I had enough handlebar to mount this, which I don't.  My fault.  So I decided to hang it on a wire bundle leaving the left handle bar.  Routing it virtually straight back to the battery, it *just* made it.  It wouldn't have from the handle bar, and certainly not from anywhere I might have chosen to drill a hole for mounting in the fairing.  This is made so damn well I just can't understand for the life of me why they didn't put an extra 12 #34; of length on it.  Someone screwed the pooch here.  This is working for me, but I don't like the way I had to mount it and I'll undoubtedly go back and relocate it, which will mean splicing the wires, which I know how to do.  So it works, but I'll still have to put in another hour or so to get it where it doesn't look jacked.  Oh, and this is to power my GPS. \n",

Just mounted it to my brush gaurd in place of 2 little 55w Baja Halogen lights which were a pain since they would bounce around a little on nasty potholes and it really sucks getting 2 spotlight beams to perfectly align all the time.  Havent used it at night but im waiting til it gets dark and ill update the review.  Having an older 2nd gen 4runner with a brush guard in front of the headlights really sucks for visibility at night, even with those Baja lights on its still hard to see far enough ahead when your going 50+ mph.  Anyways this unit seems really well built, has solid cast aluminum mounts with rubber bushings to keep it from vibrating.  No harness so we installed a Delphi Weatherpack kit (about $6) for a true plug   play setup, not to mention it looks really professional and clean with the harness and shrink wrap.  When buying LED fixtures for off road they should have a MINIMUM IP rating of 64,  RIGID INDUSTRIES I think are IP68,  these are very close at IP67:The two numbers in the IP67 rating code rating refer to:6 -    Dust Protected   ; Totally protected against dust ingress.; complete protection against contact7-    Immersion Protected   ; Protected against short periods of immersion in water.Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion). Test duration: 30 minutes;  Immersion at depth of at least 1 m measured at bottom of device, and at least 15 cm measured at top of deviceSo unless your mounting these to your underwater submarine they should do just fine under normal, and by normal I mean severe off road, conditions.

The final straw was when the tail gate fell on my wife's arm, badly bruising her upper arm. I guess we were lucky it didn't hit her in the head and knock her down.I bought a pair of these lifts and they exceeded my expectations. NOTE: You will need a 40 Torx driver (six pointed) to remove the old lifts and install the new ones. You will also need someone to hold the tail gate up for you during the process. The process of removing the old lifts and installing the new ones is easy and takes only 15 minutes, or so.After the new lifts were installed, the tail gate not only stays up, it is much easier to open. Now the tail gate opens with only minimum effort. In fact, once started, it practically opens itself.

This is no joke: it took me longer to read the instructions on how to install them than it did to install them (the instructions aren't crystal clear but they're pretty good; once you figure out how to release the old ones it's probably about as difficult as replacing a gas cap). Less than four minutes and I had both units replaced. Didn't need an assistant, just opened the hatch, used a screwdriver to release the catch and pop the top and bottom ends off. Closed the hatch while I grabbed the replacement unit, opened the hatch, popped it in place. Then repeated for the other side. The new strut had enough oomph to hold the hatch by itself.

      "Review:  I installed a pair of westin tubes almost 10 years ago.  After they rusted off, I got the aluminum sure step and this installation kit.  Probably the worst instructions I have ever seen.  Seriously, how hard is it to write some decent instructions. I could spend 10 minutes and write a better set of instructions.  After you get one side done, you figure it out.  The worst offense is that the brackets aren't engineered to fit correctly.  The bracket will bend the lower lip of the sheet metal as you tighten down the bolts.  It should have been at 90 degrees, but it is at about 80 degrees so the thin metal is stressed.  The bolts are barely big enough to get threaded, because of the incorrectly engineered bracket.  Once you finally get it threaded, it starts to bend the metal out.  Like the other poster mentioned, the self tapping screws are barely long enough and you have to be very delicate while drilling and set the clutch on the drill low so you don't drill out the hole completely like I did on my first hole.  I'm not convinced it will hold.  I may tack weld the brackets on if it gets loose.  I'm not thrilled about drilling holes in my truck.  There are plenty of factory holes and options that should have been utilized.  I wish I had gone with a different option/brand.  With stressed metal and questionable self tapped screws, not sure how long this will last.  I'm pretty sure I will need to weld these on at some point, if I don't just rip them off and start with a different brand.  This is on a 2001 F150 supercrew. \n",

Also one of the end caps was fitted crooked. Finally, it did not fit my truck. I verified using the tool provided as well as going to Monroe website directly to make sure it fit my 1987 LandCruiser. I had to modify the shocks because the bolts inserts were too small. It made my truck bouncy on city streets, but seemed better off-road.

      "Review:  I purchased these Monroe quick-struts 2 1/2 years ago to replace a broken coil spring on my wife's 02 Focus (a common problem for that vintage Focus, thanks Ford). They were ideal for my situation because I got the whole spring/strut assembly for about what I would have paid for just springs. As a bonus, I didn't have to mess around with compressing the springs, as it was just a matter of bolting the new assembly into place. They were an exact replacement fit and they ride the same as the stock spring/struts (note: the car seemed to ride 'higher' for a few months, but the springs have since settled in). I would have reviewed them earlier but after installing them, I began hearing faint suspension related noises and held off until I tracked down the source. That turned out to be a failing motor mount (again, thanks Ford). Long story short, I completely forgot to review these struts. So with the hindsight of 2 1/2 years and 28,000 miles, I can report they are still working beautifully. No leaks at the struts, springs are in good shape, and an overall stock like handling suspension. \n",

They are easy to install and fit securely into the mounts. They are a good product.Bad: These inserts basically turn your mounts into solid mounts.

At stoplights, my front bumper rattled, the steering wheel shook, Sunroof cover rattled, the change in my center console danced around, etc...

One of these problems was that the side power and heated rear view mirrors would move up, but not down, left, or right.  The passenger side mirror was broken, and was replaced, but the remote control would not function except to move the mirrors up.I looked here and found this switch.  I was encouraged because in appearance it was an almost perfect match for the switch I needed to replace.  The only difference was that my existing switch had black buttons, and this one was grey.  When I attemtped to order it, the drop down menus to check compatability appeared at the top of the page, asking for year, make, and model of the vehicle.  When that information was entered, the system advised that this switch would not fit my vehicle.  None of the other switches shown were even close in appearance.  I took a chance and ordered the switch anyway.  It arrived today, and except for color was an exact match of my exisitng switch.

On the 5.3 litre GM engines, BEWARE there is an oil filter screen directly below this sensor.  REMOVE IT and throw it away.  It is meant to filter oil before the sensor , but mine plugged and i cleaned it a yr ago with carb cleaner, but plugged again. I removed the screen filter with a pick, and installed the sensor approx 6 months ago--still works fine. Filters havent been around under the sensors for 50 yrs but im sure that its there for a reason.....but i was tired of dealing with it.  Sensor can be installed without removing intake plenum, just use a socket and a u-joint swivel and you can access the sensor- its a 30 min job.....i can do it in 5 min now that i know how to do it. good luck. remove that oil filter screen under the sensor!! \n",

I had to find the right pilot bearing locally.Now, the pilot bearing itself is only $12-$15 (and the right size alignment tool won't cost much either--I wrapped duct tape on mine to make it the right size and everything lined up pretty easily), so don't let that stop you from ordering this otherwise perfect way to get rid of your clunky dual-mass OEM flywheel, which you should probably not resurface anyway! \n",

      "Review:  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It is totally garbage! I had to replace the oil cooler lines on my 2000 Blazer, so I found this piece of crap(didn't know at the time). I removed the old one because it was leaking where the steel met the rubber. First of all, when I went to install the new one, (mind you, this is a   direct fit   part)one of the hoses kinked....are you kidding me???!!! So anyway, I used about 5 zip ties around that area to prevent it from kinking. I installed this part in October, 2011. Here it is April, 2012, I decided to do an oil change and when I went to replace the filter, I looked up through the access door, and this   wonderful   piece of automotive engineering looked like it was about 100 years old! The rubber part of the assembly was all dried out, cracked, and starting to leak. I suppose I could get a replacement under warranty, but I don't want to get stuck doing this job again in another 6 months. The original one lasted for 160,000 miles. Just goes to show, when it says   made in China  , it's junk. Unfortunately, 90% of everything in this country is made in China nowadays. Looks like I'll have to go to the dealer   pay an arm   a leg if I want it to last. I will NEVER buy anything manufactured by Dorman ever again! \n",

While it may be as good as original, I can't rate it any better for the following reasons:  As other reviewers noted, it is different from original, there are NO instructions, and it is missing parts (2 nuts as mentioned in other reviews).  Some may be smarter or luckier than me, but I found it to be a royal pain to figure out correct angle/installation.  As for the references to YouTube instructions, from what I found (and I looked) there are no videos that cover the most difficult part of job: how to fit in a part that looks considerably different from the one you just removed.  For those who are where I was 2 hours ago:- Get the 2 nuts (10 mm) before you try to install new part.- Attach the arm (to left) with the protruding bolts through door w/ new nuts.- Once this is in place, it may be easier to figure out how to attach part (it DOES fit).- When in place properly, the motor should sit in upper right corner, pointing straight up,  if you are looking at it straight on (as if you could see through the door panel); if you look down from above, you see the cylinder shape of top of motor).- The four original bolts (in rectangular pattern) will go in place once it is sitting properly.- You will have 3 extra bolts from original that aren't needed .Good luck. \n",

Opening the box I found the regulator, a piece of paper with information type on it describing the possible changes from the OEM part.  A small plastic bag with two nuts and a bolt in it. I removed the door panel. Taped the window and removed all the bolts. Removed the old regulator. Just as I figured the control cable had rusted and broken. I compared the new one to the OEM. On the bottom of the regulator where there was two bolts, there are welded studs on the new one.. Also, a support bracket mid way on the right side of the part is not present on the new one. It installed with ease. Studs lined up, all bolts lined up with no problems. Window clamps appeared to be the same as the OEM and tightened to the glass. Powered up and a few test runs all appeared to be fine. Time will tell.The paper work explained the difference of the OEM and the replacement with pictures, its a copy, but readable.I hope the missing support on the right side of the frame does not cause any problem later but time will tell. The paper work shows a picture and explains the missing point of contact.If you want to review the removal/installation of the door regulator, there's lots of videos online to show you the proper way to repair your regulator.The up/down speed appeared normal and non-laboredThis is an easy repair for the mechanically challenged.It took about an hour or so. Most of that was taking my time and removing the door panel, plastic and wire's and reinstalling them. Take your time and all will work out for this product.The part was priced anywhere from $40.00 to $60.00 dollars cheaper then I found at Auto Zone or Advanced Auto.

Oh, speaking of useless, after two separate (new) blades were installed, the passenger side blade simply made NO contact with the windshield.

      "Review:  I bought a pair of these to replace the disintegrating OEM blades on a 2006 E91 BMW 325xi. Installation wasn't the easiest, as BMW, in its infinite complicating wisdom, uses a special pin mount instead of the usual U-hook. Attachment involved removing a piece from the blade mount, and forcing the slightly-too-small pin hole on the blade onto the slightly-too-large pin on the wiper arm. (There are two pin holes on the wiper mount: a little too small, and way too large.)Note that these blades are reversible on their mounts, to match the curvature of your windshield. The blade carrier separates from the piece that attaches to the wiper arm, and can be reattached facing either left or right. Until I figured this out, the left blade kept a triangle of windshield directly in front of the driver's face un-wiped. I'm guessing that this is probably in the manual, so do read it.As with other Rain-X blades I've installed on other cars, these wipe with the best. \n",

Makes removing the wiper, later on, much easier, because the cap keeps dirt etc. out of the wiper to wiper arm connection area. Unfortunately, these do not fit the rear window of the Subaru Forester 2005, as Amazon's car part finder suggested. The size of the blade is correct, but the connector is wrong.The blade needs to have a large round plastic dowel across the middle of the insertion area, so that the dowel swings up into place on the car's wiper connector arm. The rear window of the 2005 Subaru Forester does not have the standard   push it on the hook of the connector arm   setup. The Advantage series is the same as the Evolution series minus the protection cap, so these should be an excellent blade overall. \n",

      "Review:  It was with GREAT anticipation that I waited for my opportunity to acquire my Valeo Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season  22 #34; Wiper.  The stories of prowess shared by my fore-fathers were legendary.  My mother spoke of Valeo, himself, as the master of all wipers and was clearly the most superior at removing debris from surfaces.In driving through my neighborhood, I saw the drone lifting off from my neighbor's front yard.  Upon closer look, I saw a glow of light from the sky shining down on the box.  It was as though the heavens were shining down on the very cardboard box containing my 22 #34; wiper.  As I reached the front porch, I quickly realized the wiper must be inside.  (Of course, I realized this after I put the box in my car and drove directly home and into my garage, where I ripped open the box with my bare hands.)I have acquired many smiley face boxes in a similar manner, but this one was the box of all boxes.  Upon opening the box, the 22 #34; wiper instantly flew from the opening and began rubbing across my car.  The rust bubbles and mud disappeard, then i noticed the paint shined like new. I have no idea how it worked that magic, but it was as though Frosty the Snowman, himself, was behind it.  I thought 22 #34; wipers were only for glass windsheilds, but this 22 #34; one... this ULTIMATE All-Season Valeo 22 #34; wiper was not only 'All-Season,' but it was also 'All-Car' and 'All Miracle! #34;As it glided across the paint, scratches vanished.  Across the chrome, all pitting removed.  I was astonished to see rubber actually re-appear on the tire tread as it gently stroked across it.  By the time the wiper finished, my car not only looked new again, it was a completely different color.I assure you that if you buy this wiper, and use it on your car, you will be more than thrilled.WARNING:  Use on your wife at your own risk.  After seeing how it made my car look new, I could not help but wonder if it could do the same for my wife.  After using it on my wife, (just a light touch), she was transformed to the beautiful woman I married all those years ago.  Her body was all firm and tight with skin as beautiful and smooth as a baby's skin.  Unfornately, she took one look in the mirror and instantly left me for my neighbor who had ordered the 24 #34; wiper.  I never realized she would leave me just to get a man who had 2 more inches. \n",

Before you order from Amazon, be sure to use the pop-up link to find the proper size for your vehicle. The blades come in both A and B sizes and different lengths. Some vehicles take different lengths for each side of the wind-shield. My Ford Edge takes the 26 A and the 20A.  I did not see a size listed on the website for the rear window wiper.I went to the Bosch web site before installing and they have a wonderful, helpful video about installation. Just search it under   wiper blades   on their site. Lots of helpful information there, for someone who never had to change their old blades. The packaging was simple to open after seeing the video. No need for box cutters or scissors like some over packaged goods.Another helpful hint from the video is to place a towel on the windshield in case the blade snaps out of your hand. (prevent a cracked windshield). You are also told the some vehicles require the blade to be in a vertical position before replacing, so sit in the car and turn on the wiper until it is upright. I know it sounds simple to you mechanical types, but tips like these mean a lot to those of us who were used to Service Stations actually giving service and when the local gas station attendant would check your wipers if asked.This is a good product, works well and is easy to do it yourself. \n",

      "Review:  First, these blades are priced on the economical side so you will not get the sleek look of an expensive blade.  Personally, that is not something that matters to me, I am more concerned with performance and ease of installation.  I replaced my Altima's worn blades with this 17 #34; blade and a 28 #34; blade from this series. I was very happy with the 28 #34; blade but found performance of the 17 #34; blade to be just ok.First, installation was pretty simple.  I am not mechanical but I replaced both blades in about 5 minutes. However, the 17 #34; blades did not seem to have enough tension to lie flat on the windshield and left a lot of streaking where the last four inches of the blade met the glass.  I bent the blade a bit and that helped but there was still some streaking.  Not a lot but this is not an issue I've had with other 17 #34; replacement blades.  This is often a problem with the 28 #34; blades. Oddly, the 28 #34; companion blade worked very well! No streaking for that one. So, ok performance but nothing fantastic. \n",

      "Review:  Agreeing with some critiques, the part that hooks onto the wiper arm is very bulky and is an eyesore.  The blade itself is low profile (as is with the new curved, steel-scaffolding-less wipers) but it is completely offset by the ugly plastic hump that joins the blade to the arm.  I was able to modify it to make it look far better than what it originally came as.  Be warned though that the stated lengths may not have the same exact proportions as the OEM-type wiper blades.  Some customers stated that the wipers are too short in some areas where it leaves a larger triangle left in the middle or they are too long that the blades nick eachother while being operated.  These are still good wipers with some shortcomings, thankfully of which did not affect me.Tips, I keep an older set of wipers on my car in the summertime because I may rarely use them.  I keep these on in the wintertime just because they are a bit pricier and don't want them to wear out so soon.  The older OEM style wipers can be refilled with just the rubber piece.  Once the Valeo ones go bad, you have to purchase the whole blade.  Summertime conditions can dry out and wear the rubber much faster.  At least the cold and perhaps wetter winter seasons can keep the rubber edges from going bad. \n",

I then tried this one, and it fit just fine on my 2002 Highlander, and it looks like it would work for my 09 highlander also. \n",

      "Review: Took about 2 minutes for each blade to remove and replace with new ones.  These come with the frame and not just the blades. The original frames fade in the sun and can use replacing every 30-50k miles.  Watch out...the Camry takes two different sizes one for the driver side and second for the passenger side.\n",

      "Review:  First of all, all of the reviewers that gave these a negative review before me are all nuts. I've been using these for around a week or so now, and they are by far the best wiper blades you can buy (if you can really get excited about wiper blades). They are very sturdy, hug the windshield smoothly and evenly, and create a streak-free wipe every time, no matter how hard it rains. I have yet to test these in the winter, but with their frame-less design, I doubt these will under-preform. The only reasons I would believe some people don't like these are because those people are either cheap (These are about double the cost of regular blades, but are definitely worth it) or they don't use the Rain-X Windshield Treatment in addition to these. Like with Rain-X Washer Fluid, even though it doesn't mention this on the bottle, if you don't use the Rain-X Treatment along with it, it will make your windshield even dirtier after using it. It wasn't until I used the Rain-X Treatment along with the Washer Fluid until the product worked like a charm. The Rain-X Windshield Treatment does an awesome job at increasing visibility during showers, so it's a good thing to use anyways. If you're looking to get new blades, these are the best you can get, and will produce much better results than standard wiper blades. \n",

So, here we go again.I wouldn't have known about this company/wiper if it hadn't been offered in Vine. I received it, installed it (very easy to install... correct fit, etc.), and tested it. Works great at freeway speeds, cleaning the windshield, etc. I purchased the RH wiper because of this. \n",

      "Review:  I relied on the Amazon's recommendation engine to find the right size for my BMW 323i.  It turns out the driver side recommended blade is 2   shorter than the OEM blades.  They still work, however, but I am sure a portion of my windshield is now missing coverage.  Can't comment on the actual functionality of the product yet, as we only had one storm so far.Update:  Just had some decent rain storm in Calif.  These blades performed fine when working.  BUT ...1) Driver's side is clearly too short, adn about 1.5   patch in the middle of my windshield is not covered.  No big deal practically, but annoying.2) When driving fast on the freeway, there was one time, maybe because of heavy wind, the driver side wiper actually lifted - as in, not touching the glass.  This happened on one side.  When compared to the OEM blade, the OEM frame is a lot heavier, and has a contraption that seems like an airfoil.  Maybe this is why.  Compared to OEM blade, Anco seems light weight.  Overall, can't say I would recommend these for my car (BMW). \n",

      "Review:  I'm comparing this to a   premium   Michelin wiper blade I had installed previously on my Civic, which I had purchased at the local Wal*Mart, and I think it holds up quite nicely. First of all, they both have a bracketless construction which prevents chunks of ice from getting stuck between the arms which would otherwise cause the wiper to become ineffective. Come blizzard time here in New England, that will be much appreciated.  This wiper installed more easily than the Michelin; the default mounting bracket worked perfectly and there was only one way--the correct way--to snap the blade onto my wiper arm. In addition, the mounting bracket is somewhat closed to the elements, and should prevent ice and other foreign objects from getting lodged there.So, I would characterize this wiper as well and thoughtfully constructed.[Update: wiper failed when the blade shredded after 2,5 years of service, pretty good as these things go.]As for the breast cancer awareness ribbon logo, it is clearly visible to the driver. I don't know what to think about that. My dear sister is a breast cancer survivor, and the disease has cost me in emotional pain; maybe I don't want to be reminded of that pain every day on the way to work. \n",

This is the second generation Mazda 6, and I believe model changed again in 2014.Finding the right refill can be a challenge. Local pep boys does not stock refills and wants you to get complete wiper arm, Napa had generic refill but they lacked the metal strips. The metal strips are what gives the blade its spring, which in turns allows its to form fit to the glass.I measured my old ones, and they were 8mm. Just like these. As there are wide, narrow, extra narrow, best to measure first.For what it's worth, parts search returned these,   45-240 and 46-180   for driver/passenger respectively, they also listed the trico   17-240 and 17-180  . Not sure what those would have done and not clear what the difference is.Install tip: follow directions. ;)Seriously, they are picture based directions that have 3 steps so not hard. The metal strips can fall out easily. The new refill should have plastic clips that keeps everything together. Leave the clips on, and as you insert the new refill they will be pushed to the end and come off. \n",

Both have narrow wipers of appropriate length and are supposed to be compatible with this product.The refills are just a tiny bit too wide (not more than 0.5mm or 1mm too wide) and that makes them 100% unusable. On the Ford, where I was lucky and I managed to squeeze the refills in it took FOREVER to get it right (I spent almost 30 minutes on the first wiper and about 15 on the second)On the Mazda, I just couldn't get it done. I had to use pliers to slightly widen the gap on the little metal pieces that are supposed to hold the refill just to get it through and ended up destroying my blades.I cannot think of a single good thing to say about this item!do yourself a favor and buy a different product. \n",

Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.  But the battery fits and works well, just wish it was as described. \n",

He use to work on motorcycles, so he knows the procedures on how to install a battery in a motorcycle and how to charge them properly before installed in the bike.  So this battery was a dud. There was a no return policy, so I wasted my money. Would not recommend this product from this seller.  VERY VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. And this is the first time I have EVER given a bad review.

      "Review:  I was a bit worried about ordering a battery from Amazon especially after the poor review and date problem listed below but, our travel trailer battery was dead and after checking local prices (whew!) decided to give this a try.After reading all the reviews, opted for this one and then noticed, WarehouseDeals had one available for a few bucks less. Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was   uh-oh   because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh! Oh - it was dirty as all get-out but I saved about $100 so still very pleased! \n",

Most of the setting ran on the trolling motor was 1 and 2 from 5 selections (5 being highest output) We did encounter some head winds for some of this time.  I emailed my findings to VMAX and they replied back promptly that the conditions I gave them and the life of the battery was about what was to be expected.

      "Review:  UPDATE 2/05/12 - Amazon is allowing me to return all six reels I bought with them paying postage, even though I bought them nearly a year ago. I have no need for spools of fake copper wire made out of 95% aluminum.UPDATE 2/03/12 - just today I became aware of the review by Kyle A. Stein, to see it click on the reviews of the black color of this same wire, BC4B-100.  He reports that it only has a trace of copper and it's mostly aluminum. I will be contacting Amazon about possible fraud.________________________________________________  now back to original review from early 2011:I just took delivery on a spool of this in black and a spool of it in red, and I'll describe it here... but first, I'd like to ask anyone out there if this is really copper wire.IS IT?Amazon is a nice buying experience usually, but in some cases - like this - there is no way to get a quick answer to a question, I don't know if I should return it or not.The wire is silvery-color instead of copper-color.  Now this could be because it's plated in silver or tin, which would be ok, or it could be that it's steel wire, which would not be OK.  Wish me luck in figuring that out.  The description claims it to be copper wire, but it is not copper color.It is also not what one usually thinks of as battery cable, which is that fairly-rigid stuff that battery cables are made out of. This has much finer strands, and to my eye looks a lot narrower in the total strands than 4 gauge battery cable.It is limp as a noodle, also unlike normal battery cable, and I assume it is more for installing stereo systems than being used as robust battery cable.Any recommendations out there for how I can tell? I think I'll probably be returning it, because it simply isn't regular battery cable wire.  But I might keep it IF it turns out to be copper wire. \n",

Until you look at the other terminal and  #8230; yeah.WhoTF changes out one battery terminal? Why not sell them as a pair? So it's back to waiting on Amazon Prime to deliver a second terminal so I can finish the job right.I still gave it 5 stars as it was cheaper than the competition, is well made and looks great.Buy with confidence. \n",

      "Review:  As my Amazon name indicates, I am not an auto technician. Mechanics, however, has been one of my hobbies since I was a teenager. I have owned a number of different used cars over the years, and several of them when purchased had terminals which were crusty to the point of being irreparable. Once I installed new cables, I sprayed their metal ends with this product occasionally and never had any problems with buildup again. It also works well for coating wherever the negative cable connects to the frame on an older truck or full framed car.  Since it's not something I use very often (one coating usually lasts a year or so, and I live in a very dry climate), one can lasts me quite awhile. The can I am using now may only be the second one I ever purchased. \n",

      "Review:  Last week driving my Nissan Quest the kids left some lights on and the battery died.  Lucky for me a friend had a portable battery charger.  It was about 3 degrees outside so I was really lucky.  That got me thinking that I really needed to get one.  After some research I decided to go with the JNC300XL.  It had the most reviews and for the price I seemed like a good deal to me.  I received this on Wednesday 1/22/14.  I was sick so I was unable to charge it until afternoon of 1/23/14.  It charged for about 18 hours, then Friday 1/24/14 (today) my wife woke me up.  Said the battery was dead in the other van.  I checked the charge indicator on this unit and it was 3/4.  I hooked it up to the van and bam was able to start the van right up.  I know people are not 100% sure how to hook up the jumper cables.  I've 100% of the time hook up the red (+)  and the black (-) to the battery terminals.  I don't ground the black to the car, and 100% of the time I'm able to crank over the car.  I've never had an issue with sparking etc.  I've helped my friends and I show up and I see how they have the jumper cables hooked up and they are having a hard time jumping their own car, and I have them shut everything off, then hook up the cables directly, and bam jump the car.  Take it for what it's worth.Pros:- didn't take long to charge the internal battery before jumping my car- light weight- AC adapter to charge the battery easy to use (some require you to use a extension cord)- Design (like the way they give you a nice safe way to clamp your cords to the pack. Helps with them to not accidently touch and helps prevent any foreseeable fire damage by crossing.Cons:Non yet I've only owned this unit for 3 days. \n",

      "Review:  I have bought a couple of department store booster packs in the past and they never seem to last more than 2-3 years. I decided to do a little research and invest in a high quality one. I found this one on amazon and I love it. It is very durable, holds a charge for a ridiculously long time and can provide multiple boosts on a single charge. I wish I had found this sooner instead of wasting money on the cheap department store ones I had in the past.One thing to note is that It doesn't have built in reverse polarity protection so make sure you connect the leads to the right battery terminal (eg. positive to positive). It sounds like a no-brainer, but I was I wasn't paying attention one night and connected them in reverse and blew the main fuse on a vehicle that I was boosting. So the car had to sit there till the next day when I could come back with a new fuse. Oops! Needless to say I pay more attention when I connect this starter now. I think I prefer it without the idiot-proof reverse polarity protection.  Keep it simple and avoid additional electronics.This thing has been extremely useful for me, and provides peace of mind in the cold winter mornings.

It has only jump started a car once.I took it apart to see if the problem was something obvious (I am an electrical engineer) but other than some bad solder joints nothing was apparent.  With an known good charger connected,  the battery voltage is about 3.5V.  Either the battery has an internal short or the charger circuit has failed... or both.  The internal circuit breaker was not open.Good thing I had taken it in to charge it and didn't find out how junky it is when i really needed it!Addendum (2/24/2014).

If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.

I started comparing prices and shopped the usual stores online like Autozone, Advance Auto and Pep Boys, only to discover that the aftermarket items had no rain shield or bracket, and instructions on Youtube indicated you'd need to take the bracket off of your old one and transfer it to the new part, however I'd discovered mine was missing, so there was no old part to rob the necessary parts from.  That's when I started searching for the factory OEM replacement part in hopes that it would be complete.  As usual I shopped around for the best deal and after finding the correct part number I did a more specific search.  Amazon's price was far below both the aftermarket and OEM part I found elsewhere, and it also had the rain shield.

I replaced the temp door actuator and... still stuck on hot... bummed me out but I did some more research which lead me to to do the following.  With the ignition key off I unplugged the AC/Heater programmer module (its located behind the glove box with a couple of big wire harness connectors plugged into it, access it by lowering the black panel underneath the glove box) and let it power down for a couple of minutes. With the key still off I reconnected both connectors, then turned the key to on for 3 minutes, without starting the engine. This process clears any codes that were stored in the module and forces it to go through a door position   learn   test, which properly activated the actuator and now my dual zone climate controls are functioning normally once again!  Wish I'd known about the relearn procedure before I started, might have saved me the cost of an actuator... but it did quit working properly for some reason, and it may have only delayed my purchase a few days before it failed again.

      "Predicted Label: Correct Size/\n",
      "Review:  There is a known problem on some Government Motors (GM) products, including Chevy Silverado trucks, of the ABS falsely activating at low speeds while decelerating from approximately 7 to 3 mph. Although this is not a major safety hazard making the truck undriveable, it is extremely annoying, almost as annoying as the costly GM bailout, LOL! Fortunately it is easy to correct without spending billions of taxpayer dollars. It is caused by an error in the front wheel speed sensors.These ACDelco sensors are the exact OEM item, and Amazon actually sells them for a lower price than some aftermarket substitutes. Replacement, while not a 15-minute breeze, is a pretty basic operation using the usual automotive tools. With the vehicle jacked up on safety stands and the front wheel removed, follow the normal procedure to remove the caliper, and then remove the rotor. The sensor is held into the hub with one Allen screw, and there is one electrical plug to disconnect, and then it's out.It is absolutely essential to be sure the mating surface on the bearing hub is immaculately cleared of any rust, using sandpaper, Scotchbrite or wire brush. Even a very thin layer of rust can prevent the sensor from seating properly and cause errors. Be sure the mounting hole is free of sanding debris. Spraying a light coat of rust preventive paint on the cleaned surface may help prevent the rust from re-appearing. Put it all back together, and then you'll have smooth stops and can quit cringing when you step on the brake pedal.The vehicle's OBD-II system may have stored a code relating to this error even after the repair. This can be cleared using a Scantool. If you don't have one, you can buy it from Amazon. \n",

      "Review:  ABS Code checks at my local Autozone narrowed my problem down to my left rear hub. The rear hubs on this 2002 Buick Lesabre have the speed sensors built into the hubs and it is the rotation of the speed sensor which provides feedback to the ABS controller. There are a number of conditions which can trigger an ABS code and in my case there was a fluctuation in the DC voltage going to the left rear wheel sensor. A quick way of checking the voltage at the sensor connector is to measure the voltage at both female connections in the harness which plugs into the sensor. If the vehicle has the original speed sensor connections, one wire will be black and one wire will be white. The DC voltage on the white wire side should be less than 4.0 V DC and the black wire may show just a trace amount of voltage less than about 0.04 mV DC. I had a steady 4.0 V DC on the right side hub, but the left side kept fluctuating between 2.0 and 4.0 V DC. Initially, I thought I had a bad speed sensor in my new left hub, so I replaced the hub under warranty. Nothing lost, since I can now change out a hub in 30 minutes or less! Thinking I had a bad Delphi connector, which after several hours of searching in the Delphi catalog ended up being Connector Body P/N 12052638, Connector Seal P/N 12048086, Terminal P/N 12048074, Lock P/N 12052634, and some 20 AWG black and white multistrand wire, I ended up soldering and crimping a replacement pigtail connector which actually fit the connector mounted on the wheel hub. I spliced in my replacement pigtail and hoped the ABS light would go off. After a short test dive to get over 5 MPH, I heard the familiar 'ding' of the ABS light coming on and I thought it was best to replace the enter wheel speed sensor assembly. Initially, I was going to pull out the existing wheel speed sensor wiring harness but since GM had mounted this wiring harness to the vehicle frame before they attached the body, I simply cut the old harness ends off and ran the new wiring harness alongside the existing wiring harness using wire ties to keep the new harness in place along the vehicle frame. I plugged in the new harness to the wheel sensors, took the car for a spin, and no more ABS or Traction control light. After dissecting the old wiring harness to get to the root cause of my intermittent voltage, I found that a previous vehicle owner had spliced in about a 6 inch section of larger gage wire into the white wire which was going to the left rear speed sensor. This additional resistance was enough to affect the voltage at the sensor which triggered the ABS code. This larger wire was spliced in about 10 inches beyond where I had made my splice joint and if I had found it earlier during an inspection of the wiring harness, my custom made pigtail would have fixed the problem. In the end the $90 I paid for a replacement wiring harness was worth the money since I have now learned so much about wheel hubs, ABS sensors, wiring harnesses, and Delphi connectors. \n",

Once I bought and installed these, they were once again, factory smooth and quiet. Excellent performance and wonderful price! \n",

The pads are right and left, so fit your sensor before you begin to be sure you have them installed on the correct sides.  Mine usedBeck Arnley 084-1526 Disc Brake Pad Electronic Wear Sensorlocated on the passenger rear. This sensor also fits driver front.Use 17 MM to remove wheel, and T-40 to loosen top and bottom bolts on caliper. Slide the bolts to the out position but do not remove. Pull caliper to you slowly to push piston back to release.CAUTION: It may require that you have a computer hooked up to the system before you compress the piston.  If you can install without compressing, you would not need to hook it up. Otherwise, you may damage the ABS system by not deactivating the system using the computer (something to do with pressure).  4 star instead of 5 because you need to buy sensors separately. \n",

Essentially, the damage amounts to a corner of one of the shoe pads that had been hit and broken off (about the size of a penny) and another shoe pad had been that had been nicked pretty hard on one edge.The main fault lies with the manufacturer in that they should secure the shoes so that they can't bang against each other in shipment, but Amazon didn't do much either in that the brake shoe box was loose inside the bigger Amazon box (the lone air pillow inside was flat, should have been several more).I had also purchased some disk brake pads from the same manufacturer in a separate order which, though packaged the same way, managed to make the trip without any real damage.I gave the product 4 stars only because the shoes are supposed to be good.

If you are a machinist this is laughable for accuracy.For carpentry it's ok, and for measuring body parts it's good since 1mm is as close as you are going to get anyway.This set should cost about 2 bucks not more than double that, like I paid.That's why I rated it 3 stars. \n",

I've never had to deal with these type of brake calipers in the past and was at a loss when my C-clamp wouldn't compress the caliper in. My local Hyundai dealer called me about my other vehicle that was in the shop for more serious repair when I told him I was working on my other Hyundai and couldn't get the rear calipers compressed. He was happy to tell me how to use a pair of needle nose pliers to help screw them in. I will say it was so difficult to keep the pliers spread apart to fit the slots and I kept loosing my grip. It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in. Not sure why I had to screw them OUT to get them IN but it worked. Anyway, after dealing with that I decided that I will be purchasing a tool next time to make it easier and I think this tool will do the trick. I don't really care if it's precision made like another commenter said it needed to be. Hey, as long as it makes it easy to wind them back in right? If my needle nose pliers can get them in why wouldn't these tools?Here is what my caliper looks like [...] \n",

It survived the winter here in Upstate NY and was sitting by the pond all Spring. That frog left on the 4th of July and now two little ones have moved in. I painted the waterfall a silvery color and over the winter (I left it out not knowing where the frog was hibernating) it weathered to a nice natural look.It was very easy to put in  and the pump continues to work with no problems other than an easy cleaning which was described in the literature that came with the kit. I highly recommend this product for a small yard .It was shipped very, very quickly by Northern tool and was packaged extremely well. 5 stars all around for this pond. \n",

      "Review:  I purchased both the large and small universal adapters in order to bleed my S2000s brake and clutch master cylinders.  At first look after I initially received both items - I thought there was a mistake due to the fact they looked to be the same size.  I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder. \n",

      "Review:  Overall, this kit worked for my 2004 Toyota Sequoia. All of the springs and hold-down parts seemed to be an exact match of what I had on my car. However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are. \n",

Of course I had the truck pulled apart before I noticed. Then I had to run into town and buy the correct rotors from the local NAPA store at 5PM on a Saturday.

One blog site said the NAPA pins are better and correct this issue so I ordered those from NAPA and installed. Getting the rotor off was also a challenge.

      "Review:  My  #34;Check Engine #34; light has been on for a while on my car.  I purchased this cap as one of the possible solutions since a failed seal inside the gas cap can be one of the causes for the light.One of the reasons for choosing this cap is the fact that it is the standard Motorcraft quality guarantee.  Motorcraft is the original manufacturer and, therefore, I will have a guarantee that it will fit.The other main reason why I chose this cap is the fact that it has a tether, just like the original, to ensure that I don't lose, drop on the ground or ruin in other manner the new cap.When it arrived, it took 2 minutes to unscrew the tether on the old one and replace it with the new one.I'm extremely happy with the purchase. \n",

      "Review:  Like other's have stated, this Stant #10504Y (Yellow) locking Gas Cap did not come up as compatible with my vehicle, but the Stant #10504 (Black) Gas Cap did show compatible.  I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.  So I ordered the yellow cap as my Terrain came with an original Yellow Gas cap since it can use E-85.  I have never put E-85 in my vehicle, but wanted to keep things a near as original as possible.  I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase. \n",

      "Review:  As far as overflow bottle caps go, this one is one of the better built in a sea of copycat units.  Mine was built in Germany, but your mileage may vary.  The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted! \n",

      "Review:  Back in October of 2012 I knocked out my ambient temp sensor on my '00 528i while driving over a piece of tire on the highway on my way to work, and although I did not know what had happened that morning I figured it out on my way home that same day when the heat really kicked in and my A/C did not work.  Needless to say I was skeptical about buying this item as with most things I suppose, you really need to just stop overthinking things and decide what you want to do.  After seeing several reviews and posts on internet forums I decided to purchase this as the Texas heat was really beginning to take its toll on me.  I am the type of person that will not even change my own oil, I'll take it to the shop but usually by the time I get off work every shop is closed and besides I figured I had to get my hands dirty at some point.  I went back and looked at the forums one last time, went outside armed with only a pair of wire cutters, my socket set to disconnect the battery lead as I wasn #8217;t sure what kind of damage I was potentially looking at from my lack of experience and electrical tape of course.  Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.  This was probably as hands on as I have gotten other than replacing my own headlights not too long ago, and this is enough for a while.  A product that is packaged and includes all items as advertised, does what it is supposed to do, and relatively easy to install even for a person with no experience.  AWESOME! \n",

I also had a battery failure and never linked these two issues but in hindsight it appeared to caused the vent problem.  After reading about some horror stories of dealers charging 4-5 hrs and $150+ for the part it seemed worth trying to fix myself and good news is it's actually a pretty easy fix.Remove the driver side lower plastic dash cover by the pedals, pop off the lower vent duct (one christmas tree type snap) and then you have access.  There's two actuators and for a front vent issue the bad actuator is the lower of the two, the one closer to the driver seat.  Of course I pulled the wrong one off first and learned it controls the defrost/floor airflow and it doesn't have that white gear part shown on the picture but otherwise looks the same. \n",

That means there was a vacuum inside of it, and this is what you want. If you don't hear that sucking sound, moisture may have made its way into the unit, permanently destroying the desiccant inside. Pulling a vacuum on your system will not reverse this because the desiccant has undergone a chemical reaction.

      "Review:  As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with any mounting bolts, and the ones that come out of the compressor are about 4 inches too long, for this part. That leaves you having to go find replacement bolts, hopefully at your local hardware or auto store. It would be nice if they included some notes, indicating which size bolts you need, instead of trying to take the stock compressor bolts and match them up, to what you think will be the right length.The other issue is with the power steering pump, filler neck. In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket. Not sure why this was never accounted for, when this part was made. \n",

I did not install the in helmet speakers, preferring to use some in ear headphones. My brother had some in helmet speakers already installed and I would assume their performance would be similar to the ones provided by Cardo. He was very pleased with the sound quality and said he could hear me perfectly. I noticed that his battery lasted a bit longer than mine and I think that can be attributed to the drivers in my in ear headphones versus his in helmet speakers. Activating voice control for apple products was very simple. It's great having a device that can control your music instead of plugging some headphones directly into an iPod. Great product. \n",
