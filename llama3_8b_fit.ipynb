Lift the window up a bit and then drop the front of the windows down into the door slowly and then raise the rear of the glass up and you will start to lift the glass at a angle upwards and out of the door frame.  You will then be able to access the three screws to remove the door handle and you will only have to remove the cable pin from the door once you have access to the back of the handle.The process to remove the door handles is very very easy and you will need a P2 and P3 screw driver and a 10mm socket with extension.\n",

      "Review:  It does what it is supposed to! Sure it does not come with any instructions, why take a star away for that? Once I got the power connected to it the correct way, the unit kicks on and off solidly. There is some audible  #34;clicking #34; when the relay switches on and off, so don't worry.The BEST thing about the unit is the sensitivity adjustment. I hooked one of these up to an LED strip light going down my staircase. Lights go out, stair lights come on. There are lights in the hallway at the top of the stairs, chandelier over the staircase and natural sunlight from the side transitions on the front door. Once everything was connected I was able to adjust the sensitivity to all the lighting. Perfect!Follow the instructions from Luke and Aaron in these reviews. That should be all that you need.Could this product be better? Maybe, but for the price and how solidly it is built, I doubt you could do better. Definitely use it indoor only. Or in a water tight box if outside. Not sure how it would stand up to freezing, etc.As long as the photo eye holds out for a while, I'm satisfied.I have purchased another and will hook it up to another LED strip light configuration for over and under cabinet lighting. \n",

I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! \n",

Since batteries can't be returned in general, I figured the less spent, the less risk and opted to give it a go.When the battery arrived, my initial reaction was   uh-oh   because it was dusty and dirty. No grease or anything but lots of dust...I think there was even a shoe-print on it! I dreaded the worst thinking this thing must have been sitting around the warehouse for ages. No so! I cleaned it off a bit and saw the date being the SAME month as shipped! Wow - I can't even get batteries that new locally. In fact, I can't come anywhere near this price on this battery (or similar ones) locally...the next best price was about $100 more than what I paid.Hooked it up to see the charge...was at 92%. Charged the remainder. Works like a charm! Couldn't be more pleased by this purchase. Great battery, great price, great delivery, very fresh!

Very  Annoying!For some reason, I failed to select expedited shipping, but that wasn't a problem because the vendor shipped it the next day. Since I live in the same state, I got it the day after that. This alone warranted the 5 star rating for me as I couldn't get the battery warning to stop. The manual failed me.The battery arrived as an exact match of the original; exactly as pictured. The original battery lasted almost 13 years. Hopefully this will last as long too.After installation, my system did not immediately clear the Low Battery warning. It didn't continue to alarm, but did still show it on the consoles. This worried me at first. Sometime during the night, the system apparently did a battery check and noticed that it was fine.The battery was packaged well for shipping. Box just large enough.

The battery lasted a total of approximately 5-1/2 hours and 5-1/2 miles before losing most of its power. Most of the setting ran on the trolling motor was 1 and 2 from 5 selections (5 being highest output) We did encounter some head winds for some of this time.  I emailed my findings to VMAX and they replied back promptly that the conditions I gave them and the life of the battery was about what was to be expected.  Personally I think I was expecting a little more battery life.  Now that I know what to expect I can better judge how close I should be to the boat ramp before losing power!  Rowing blows....

      "Review:  UPDATE 2/05/12 - Amazon is allowing me to return all six reels I bought with them paying postage, even though I bought them nearly a year ago. I have no need for spools of fake copper wire made out of 95% aluminum.UPDATE 2/03/12 - just today I became aware of the review by Kyle A. Stein, to see it click on the reviews of the black color of this same wire, BC4B-100.  He reports that it only has a trace of copper and it's mostly aluminum. I will be contacting Amazon about possible fraud.________________________________________________  now back to original review from early 2011:I just took delivery on a spool of this in black and a spool of it in red, and I'll describe it here... but first, I'd like to ask anyone out there if this is really copper wire.IS IT?Amazon is a nice buying experience usually, but in some cases - like this - there is no way to get a quick answer to a question, I don't know if I should return it or not.The wire is silvery-color instead of copper-color.  Now this could be because it's plated in silver or tin, which would be ok, or it could be that it's steel wire, which would not be OK.  Wish me luck in figuring that out.  The description claims it to be copper wire, but it is not copper color.It is also not what one usually thinks of as battery cable, which is that fairly-rigid stuff that battery cables are made out of. This has much finer strands, and to my eye looks a lot narrower in the total strands than 4 gauge battery cable.It is limp as a noodle, also unlike normal battery cable, and I assume it is more for installing stereo systems than being used as robust battery cable.Any recommendations out there for how I can tell? I think I'll probably be returning it, because it simply isn't regular battery cable wire.  But I might keep it IF it turns out to be copper wire. \n",

It was about 3 degrees outside so I was really lucky.  That got me thinking that I really needed to get one.  After some research I decided to go with the JNC300XL.  It had the most reviews and for the price I seemed like a good deal to me.  I received this on Wednesday 1/22/14.  I was sick so I was unable to charge it until afternoon of 1/23/14.  It charged for about 18 hours, then Friday 1/24/14 (today) my wife woke me up.  Said the battery was dead in the other van.  I checked the charge indicator on this unit and it was 3/4.  I hooked it up to the van and bam was able to start the van right up.  I know people are not 100% sure how to hook up the jumper cables.  I've 100% of the time hook up the red (+)  and the black (-) to the battery terminals.  I don't ground the black to the car, and 100% of the time I'm able to crank over the car.  I've never had an issue with sparking etc.  I've helped my friends and I show up and I see how they have the jumper cables hooked up and they are having a hard time jumping their own car, and I have them shut everything off, then hook up the cables directly, and bam jump the car.  Take it for what it's worth.Pros:- didn't take long to charge the internal battery before jumping my car- light weight- AC adapter to charge the battery easy to use (some require you to use a extension cord)- Design (like the way they give you a nice safe way to clamp your cords to the pack.

I decided to do a little research and invest in a high quality one. I found this one on amazon and I love it. It is very durable, holds a charge for a ridiculously long time and can provide multiple boosts on a single charge. I wish I had found this sooner instead of wasting money on the cheap department store ones I had in the past.One thing to note is that It doesn't have built in reverse polarity protection so make sure you connect the leads to the right battery terminal (eg. positive to positive). It sounds like a no-brainer, but I was I wasn't paying attention one night and connected them in reverse and blew the main fuse on a vehicle that I was boosting. So the car had to sit there till the next day when I could come back with a new fuse. Oops! Needless to say I pay more attention when I connect this starter now.

The units is out of warranty so I am going to throw it away.  This unit was kept in the trunk of my car and had been periodically charged.  It has only jump started a car once.I took it apart to see if the problem was something obvious (I am an electrical engineer) but other than some bad solder joints nothing was apparent.  With an known good charger connected,  the battery voltage is about 3.5V.  Either the battery has an internal short or the charger circuit has failed... or both.  The internal circuit breaker was not open.Good thing I had taken it in to charge it and didn't find out how junky it is when i really needed it!Addendum (2/24/2014).  I disconnected appropriate wires internally and tried to charge the battery with a standard auto battery charger/starter at both 2A and 10A charge rates.  After 36 hours the battery had crept up to about 8.5V indicating the battery is bad.  Whether the charger circuit is also bad (or caused the battery failure) I do not know.  The unit is in the trash now! \n",

      "Review:  I just installed these bearings. They were  #34;snug #34; but fit well. The retaining bolts that hold them were a challenge these are on the backing plate (nothing to do with the new bearings). Make sure you put WD-40 or something like it on the center bolts and the nuts that hold the plate. Made a difference on the car's handling, much tighter (96k on Buick Park Ave). Oh yes, and make sure you tighten the center nut (this one must be really tight). You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;. I tried to buy them locally, and no one has them in stock, you get a new one if you order the whole hub assembly. These bearings from Timkin are the way to go, spend the extra for these so hopefully you don't get to do it again anytime soon.If you don't have a lift rack (I don't) figure about 2 hours a side.

If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.  You know have a repair that will outlast the engine.These fittings are ready to go complete with new O-Rings and you cannot beat the price. \n",

      "Review:  I bought my truck second hand and always assumed my actuator was unplugged or the motor was bad.  I started comparing prices and shopped the usual stores online like Autozone, Advance Auto and Pep Boys, only to discover that the aftermarket items had no rain shield or bracket, and instructions on Youtube indicated you'd need to take the bracket off of your old one and transfer it to the new part, however I'd discovered mine was missing, so there was no old part to rob the necessary parts from.  That's when I started searching for the factory OEM replacement part in hopes that it would be complete.  As usual I shopped around for the best deal and after finding the correct part number I did a more specific search.  Amazon's price was far below both the aftermarket and OEM part I found elsewhere, and it also had the rain shield.  It was an exact fit, installation was a breeze, and I didn't even need the pop rivets that are also included as I used sheet metal screws instead.  It works great and it's so nice to be able to hit the remote now as it was the driver's side, and it came in handy today because I live in the tropics and there was a deluge of flooding rain and I would have been soaked if I had to stand there fumbling with my keys. \n",

I replaced the temp door actuator and... still stuck on hot... bummed me out but I did some more research which lead me to to do the following.  With the ignition key off I unplugged the AC/Heater programmer module (its located behind the glove box with a couple of big wire harness connectors plugged into it, access it by lowering the black panel underneath the glove box) and let it power down for a couple of minutes. With the key still off I reconnected both connectors, then turned the key to on for 3 minutes, without starting the engine. This process clears any codes that were stored in the module and forces it to go through a door position   learn   test, which properly activated the actuator and now my dual zone climate controls are functioning normally once again!  Wish I'd known about the relearn procedure before I started, might have saved me the cost of an actuator... but it did quit working properly for some reason, and it may have only delayed my purchase a few days before it failed again.

      "Review:  There is a known problem on some Government Motors (GM) products, including Chevy Silverado trucks, of the ABS falsely activating at low speeds while decelerating from approximately 7 to 3 mph. Although this is not a major safety hazard making the truck undriveable, it is extremely annoying, almost as annoying as the costly GM bailout, LOL! Fortunately it is easy to correct without spending billions of taxpayer dollars. It is caused by an error in the front wheel speed sensors.These ACDelco sensors are the exact OEM item, and Amazon actually sells them for a lower price than some aftermarket substitutes. Replacement, while not a 15-minute breeze, is a pretty basic operation using the usual automotive tools. With the vehicle jacked up on safety stands and the front wheel removed, follow the normal procedure to remove the caliper, and then remove the rotor. The sensor is held into the hub with one Allen screw, and there is one electrical plug to disconnect, and then it's out.It is absolutely essential to be sure the mating surface on the bearing hub is immaculately cleared of any rust, using sandpaper, Scotchbrite or wire brush. Even a very thin layer of rust can prevent the sensor from seating properly and cause errors. Be sure the mounting hole is free of sanding debris. Spraying a light coat of rust preventive paint on the cleaned surface may help prevent the rust from re-appearing. Put it all back together, and then you'll have smooth stops and can quit cringing when you step on the brake pedal.The vehicle's OBD-II system may have stored a code relating to this error even after the repair. This can be cleared using a Scantool. If you don't have one, you can buy it from Amazon. \n",

      "Review:  ABS Code checks at my local Autozone narrowed my problem down to my left rear hub. The rear hubs on this 2002 Buick Lesabre have the speed sensors built into the hubs and it is the rotation of the speed sensor which provides feedback to the ABS controller. There are a number of conditions which can trigger an ABS code and in my case there was a fluctuation in the DC voltage going to the left rear wheel sensor. A quick way of checking the voltage at the sensor connector is to measure the voltage at both female connections in the harness which plugs into the sensor. If the vehicle has the original speed sensor connections, one wire will be black and one wire will be white. The DC voltage on the white wire side should be less than 4.0 V DC and the black wire may show just a trace amount of voltage less than about 0.04 mV DC. I had a steady 4.0 V DC on the right side hub, but the left side kept fluctuating between 2.0 and 4.0 V DC. Initially, I thought I had a bad speed sensor in my new left hub, so I replaced the hub under warranty. Nothing lost, since I can now change out a hub in 30 minutes or less! Thinking I had a bad Delphi connector, which after several hours of searching in the Delphi catalog ended up being Connector Body P/N 12052638, Connector Seal P/N 12048086, Terminal P/N 12048074, Lock P/N 12052634, and some 20 AWG black and white multistrand wire, I ended up soldering and crimping a replacement pigtail connector which actually fit the connector mounted on the wheel hub. I spliced in my replacement pigtail and hoped the ABS light would go off. After a short test dive to get over 5 MPH, I heard the familiar 'ding' of the ABS light coming on and I thought it was best to replace the enter wheel speed sensor assembly. Initially, I was going to pull out the existing wheel speed sensor wiring harness but since GM had mounted this wiring harness to the vehicle frame before they attached the body, I simply cut the old harness ends off and ran the new wiring harness alongside the existing wiring harness using wire ties to keep the new harness in place along the vehicle frame. I plugged in the new harness to the wheel sensors, took the car for a spin, and no more ABS or Traction control light. After dissecting the old wiring harness to get to the root cause of my intermittent voltage, I found that a previous vehicle owner had spliced in about a 6 inch section of larger gage wire into the white wire which was going to the left rear speed sensor. This additional resistance was enough to affect the voltage at the sensor which triggered the ABS code. This larger wire was spliced in about 10 inches beyond where I had made my splice joint and if I had found it earlier during an inspection of the wiring harness, my custom made pigtail would have fixed the problem. In the end the $90 I paid for a replacement wiring harness was worth the money since I have now learned so much about wheel hubs, ABS sensors, wiring harnesses, and Delphi connectors. \n",

I am comparing these to my previous setup, I'm not a brakes pro or professional mechanic, but I know how to do proper maintenance.Like other semi-metallic brake pads these get your wheel dirty with all the brake powder, and also these wear out quicker then ceramic. Ceramic brake pads are not suppose to be work as good unless your braking a lot to heat them up, but compared to the mess these makes and their life, ceramics would be better. Now this is just a generic review, it isn't comparing other semi-metallic brake pads, these was good for the price.

It is a crime the way car dealers and some brake shops rip people off for simple repairs. I have no problem with them making a buck, but marking labor and parts up 400% is just not right. How many naive drivers are throwing money away every day because they do not realize how simple and inexpensive brake work is. If I would have had the time, I would have installed them myself. It took the mechanic less than an hour for rotors and pads, probably would have taken me twice that, but I would have saved even more. I just don't like predator pricing.

The braking performance is very much improved over the stock pads, most notably, the Initial bite.  These pads do produce more dust than the stock pads, but it is acceptable given the improved performance.  I run white painted wheels in the summer and the dust is reasonable even given my choice of wheels.  There isn't any braking noise to speak of.

The shoes (4) are loose in the box so that they bang against each other until the customer receives them. Two of the four shoes I received were damaged. Haven't decided it I'm going to return them yet as the damage may not be a big enough problem. Essentially, the damage amounts to a corner of one of the shoe pads that had been hit and broken off (about the size of a penny) and another shoe pad had been that had been nicked pretty hard on one edge.The main fault lies with the manufacturer in that they should secure the shoes so that they can't bang against each other in shipment, but Amazon didn't do much either in that the brake shoe box was loose inside the bigger Amazon box (the lone air pillow inside was flat, should have been several more).I had also purchased some disk brake pads from the same manufacturer in a separate order which, though packaged the same way, managed to make the trip without any real damage.I gave the product 4 stars only because the shoes are supposed to be good.

If you are a machinist this is laughable for accuracy.For carpentry it's ok, and for measuring body parts it's good since 1mm is as close as you are going to get anyway.This set should cost about 2 bucks not more than double that, like I paid.That's why I rated it 3 stars. \n",

      "Review:  I'm going to purchase this tool because I needed it yesterday. I've never had to deal with these type of brake calipers in the past and was at a loss when my C-clamp wouldn't compress the caliper in. My local Hyundai dealer called me about my other vehicle that was in the shop for more serious repair when I told him I was working on my other Hyundai and couldn't get the rear calipers compressed. He was happy to tell me how to use a pair of needle nose pliers to help screw them in. I will say it was so difficult to keep the pliers spread apart to fit the slots and I kept loosing my grip. It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in. Not sure why I had to screw them OUT to get them IN but it worked. Anyway, after dealing with that I decided that I will be purchasing a tool next time to make it easier and I think this tool will do the trick. I don't really care if it's precision made like another commenter said it needed to be. Hey, as long as it makes it easy to wind them back in right? If my needle nose pliers can get them in why wouldn't these tools?Here is what my caliper looks like [...] \n",

      "Review:  I purchased both the large and small universal adapters in order to bleed my S2000s brake and clutch master cylinders.  At first look after I initially received both items - I thought there was a mistake due to the fact they looked to be the same size.  I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder. \n",

However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are. \n",

      "Review:  I bought these for my 2010 F150 along with the brake pads. The pads fit but these rotors did not. I used the Amazon parts finder that told me these were correct. At 1st glance the diameter is correct but the bolt pattern was wrong. The product may be just great but if they don't fit I can't judge. So my review gives 3 stars because they are the wrong size. Of course I had the truck pulled apart before I noticed. Then I had to run into town and buy the correct rotors from the local NAPA store at 5PM on a Saturday. I read online that the Ford caliper pins don't   float   well so the rotors don't get even wear. One blog site said the NAPA pins are better and correct this issue so I ordered those from NAPA and installed. Getting the rotor off was also a challenge. The F150 users site had a video showing how to use    bolts and the caliper bracket to   press them off  . It worked great look it up.I like the pads.

I also noticed for this order I received the brakes in separate shipments, and the brakes had different labels on the boxes (part numbers were the same).  I opened them up, and the castings for the rotors were completely different.  so before i would drill the puller holes in them I spent a half an hour taking critical measurement to make sure the rotors were the same other than the casting differences.  what bull to spend $$$ on rotors and have to spend hours making the #$%#^ things the way they should have been and making sure they are the right parts to start with.

I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.  So I ordered the yellow cap as my Terrain came with an original Yellow Gas cap since it can use E-85.  I have never put E-85 in my vehicle, but wanted to keep things a near as original as possible.  I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase. \n",

      "Review:  As far as overflow bottle caps go, this one is one of the better built in a sea of copycat units.  Mine was built in Germany, but your mileage may vary.  The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted! \n",

Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.  This was probably as hands on as I have gotten other than replacing my own headlights not too long ago, and this is enough for a while.  A product that is packaged and includes all items as advertised, does what it is supposed to do, and relatively easy to install even for a person with no experience.  AWESOME! \n",

      "Review:  I had the same issue as another reviewer...  2003 Trailblazer LS HVAC vents not working for the front vents / no air flow but worked for defrost and lower.  I also had a battery failure and never linked these two issues but in hindsight it appeared to caused the vent problem.  After reading about some horror stories of dealers charging 4-5 hrs and $150+ for the part it seemed worth trying to fix myself and good news is it's actually a pretty easy fix.Remove the driver side lower plastic dash cover by the pedals, pop off the lower vent duct (one christmas tree type snap) and then you have access.  There's two actuators and for a front vent issue the bad actuator is the lower of the two, the one closer to the driver seat.  Of course I pulled the wrong one off first and learned it controls the defrost/floor airflow and it doesn't have that white gear part shown on the picture but otherwise looks the same. \n",

      "Review:  When I removed one of the caps, I could hear an air sucking sound (like when you open a vacuum-sealed glass jar for the first time). That means there was a vacuum inside of it, and this is what you want. If you don't hear that sucking sound, moisture may have made its way into the unit, permanently destroying the desiccant inside. Pulling a vacuum on your system will not reverse this because the desiccant has undergone a chemical reaction. This is why you need to replace this part any time you open your system.I am very happy with this transaction! \n",

As others have mentioned the bolts that are included did not work with my vehicle (GMC Sierra SL, 4.6L vortex V6) and i had to add some hardware in order to make the compressors mounting bolts work.  I also had to cut a hole out of this pulley's bracket in order to use the throttle cable bracket that was mounted to my ac compressor.  all in all a good buy as it saved me a few hundred bucks that I would've spent if I had bought an ac compressor instead \n",

      "Review:  As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit does not come with any mounting bolts, and the ones that come out of the compressor are about 4 inches too long, for this part. That leaves you having to go find replacement bolts, hopefully at your local hardware or auto store. It would be nice if they included some notes, indicating which size bolts you need, instead of trying to take the stock compressor bolts and match them up, to what you think will be the right length.The other issue is with the power steering pump, filler neck. In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket. Not sure why this was never accounted for, when this part was made. \n",

My cooling application requires that all the metals in the loop be either nickel or copper to prevent galvanic corrosion.  This radiator would probably work fine in a car but thats besides the point when the manufacturers description on their website and every parts house I could find specifically mentions COPPER cores.  BUYER BEWARE. \n",

      "Review:  Bought this for my 1970 Chevelle. The first thing that I noticed was the transmission cooler line connection fittings needed adapters. Then I found that the upper/inlet hose was the wrong size. The radiator inlet is 1 1/4 #34; and the original radiator was 1 1/2 #34;, so the hose was too big. I thought I might have gotten the wrong radiator, so I went to Spectra's website and  looked it up. Then I found that there's a kit, with adapters and fittings. So where's the kit? It wasn't in the box. Now I have to find, and buy, the hose adapter and cooler line fittings. Take my advice and spend more money for a better radiator. \n",

It took me about an hour but, again, I have no experience working on engines, etc. other than to change the oil and simple maintenance-type jobs. Even a semi-experienced person could probably have the old intake out and the new one installed in about 20 minutes. With a small socket set, a screwdriver and/or a cordless drill, this can be done with little or no problems. The one suggestion I would make to people installing this (or if I had it to do over again) is that I would go ahead and attach the breather hose to the Volant vent BEFORE the vent is installed, as it is a very snug fit and can be a little awkward to fit on once the vent is installed. Everything else was a piece of cake.I read some reviews that the Volant instructions weren't very good but I found them to be very clear and concise (although, b/c of my ignorance, I had to search online to make sure I was unscrewing the MAF sensor and not something else)...Packaging and shipping were great (I got mine in 2 days for free with my Amazon Prime membership).Now, the results...it definitely makes acceleration a little   throatier   than before but it's not obnoxious. I was worried that my truck might sound like a Harley with the new intake but that's not the case. It is a bit louder at the top end of acceleration than I planned for but, even still, not obnoxious. It sounds tough. My truck now has a noticeable increase in acceleration, which is what I bought it for. It's too early to tell the impact, if any, on gas mileage but I've read and heard consistently that it will give you an extra 1-1/2-3 MPG increase, which is always nice. Would definitely recommend. \n",

      "Review:  I wanted a somewhat higher reach for my 120cc XR. Problem: Budget. This Hot Cams Stage 1 is an excellent choice for an XR75, XR80, XR100 (and some CRF100) stick that doesn't require much more than...itself. Higher lift and duration cam$ will generally require AT LEAST $OME headwork, and possibly a s $lew of other item$ if you want to BEST release it's potential. I pried and PRIED when I was evaluating the BBR and TB cams that are included in their FULL 120cc kits. Seems to me that most folks who sell kits/cams just don't say (nor even claim to know) their spec's. Well, it turns out that they are essentially stock grinds, as of this writing. This info comes INDIRECTLY (but finally) from the TB and BBR parts themselves. Both companies reserve the right to change their previously   mysterious   spec's. Again I ponder: If you could grind a cam to ANY profile, why retain a STOCK profile and just label it   performance  ? Importantly, in my budget, heaping on expense for NO PERFORMANCE GAIN is just stupid. So, for me, this cam is the logical choice for a mid/high range boost and maintaining a   plug and play   profile. A compromise? $ure. Uniquely, Hot Cams puts their spec's in mm. I have converted those to inches to make the spec's a little more obvious. The Intake profile looks predictable, but I detect some R D; voodoo on the Exhaust side. The STOCK Honda grind is .240 lift (intake and exhaust) and 225 duration degrees (intake and exhaust) at .004 lash, per Megacycle Cams.Bottom line: THIS is an entry level cam choice that SHOULD be   included   the BBR and TB kits. How about:   Stage for Wage  ?   Thrift to Lift Ratio  ?  Blindly paying AGAIN for stock is off the table.Pro: Mild power increases WITHOUT any other expense. Better than presently included TB and BBR 120 kit cams.Con: Expensive for   entry level  .Why not 5 stars:  Good cam that mostly helped increase mid/top rev pull. But even with the Friendly Amazon Bargain, (One ten-ish, free ship), the cost is about 45 high for an   entry level   grind.Hot Cams Stage 1  XR100 (75,80cc, SOME CRF100 also.

Took some staring at to decide how to approach it.  I did the PS belt, the serpentine belt, the tensioner, and the mount at the same time, working back and forth from above and below with the passenger side front wheel off.

      "Review:  I specifically ordered this  #34;Anchor #34; brand mount based on positive feedback on the Piloteers forum.  What I received was a mount with the same model number but, had a different manufacturers label and no mention of Anchor brand.  After initially panicking, I was scheduled to install the next day, I contacted Anchor and confirmed that these were indeed rebranded Anchor motor mounts.  As for the quality, fit and finish - The fit was good and they installed with little difficulty.  The quality appeared to be similar to the original equipment although, I noticed some defects in the paint which already had signs of rust.  Not perfect but, I received them quickly due to Prime and saved a ton of $ over the cost of the Honda original equipment replacement.  I replaced the passenger side mount at the same time and my review for that mount is exactly the same as this.  Tip: If you decide to DIY the motor mounts on your Pilot / Ridgeline or Passport, make sure you are prepared to replace all of the small plastic molding clips that hold on the splash shield under the front bumper.  The small ones are brittle and are not designed to be removed and reinstalled.  order a pack of these: http://www.amazon.com/Push-type-Fastener-91503-SZ3-003-Element-Ridgeline/dp/B00842A7F4/ref=sr_1_3?s=automotive ie=UTF8 qid=1395075816 sr=1-3 keywords=91512-sx0-003.  You'll only need about 14 or so but, they are cheaper in bulk.  There are 3 or 4 larger clips which you might be able to carefully removed without breaking but, mine were brittle and I cracked a couple of them.  The Honda part number is 91503-sz5-003.

Just make sure when you do it that you know the torque specifics and the tightening sequence. Everything went together pretty well. The only issue I had was that the PCV valve included in the kit was leaking at the fitting where it connected to the upper intake plenum. I ended up taking it off and putting the old one back on. I think the actual PCV valve itself on the Dorman kit was allowing to much oil past.Once completed, the P0171 code was gone, but I still have the P0174 code.

      "Review:  Chrome Valve Cover - The Amazon site stated that the Chrome Valve Cover would fit my 225 slant six engine.  It fits, but is not a stock application.  This valve cover only has two holes, the stock valve cover has three holes...1 for the oil cap, 1 for the breather cap, and 1 for the pcv valve.  If I use the chrome valve cover I cannot use the stock breather cap, and must use an after market push-on cap in order to have an access hole to put in oil.  Using this type of breather cap reqiuires either plugging the line from the air cleaner or purchasing an after-market custom air cleaner that also won't support the stock fresh air intake.  Unless you are willing to make several custom alterations, I suggest staying with a stock valve cover.  One other thing, the two holes in the chrome valve cover aren't the same size as the ones in the stock valve cover, so plan to buy new grommets also. \n",

Learned the job would go a lot smoother by removing the exhaust at the block.  It was three bolts on either side of the block, the hangar bolt, and then the two spring bolts in the rear which broke due to rust so for $11 just get them ahead of time just in case.  Makes removing the old cat from the exhaust header so much easier not to mention reattaching the new one back on to the header.  If you do it this way you'll want to get two new exhaust header gaskets in addition to the front gasket and the rear donut gasket for the new cat.  Oh and since the heat shields are built in to this new cat there is no need to try and remove any of the old shields.  Plus at $265 it was the best deal anywhere. \n",

      "Review:  I have a 98 civic LX that has undergone the infamous cracking of the exhaust manifold/catalytic converter combo.  Had cel for months and could smell exhaust all the time. I scoured the internet looking for advice and directions on replacements.  I finally decided on this model and have absolutely no complaints!!  As stated in other posts, the packaging left something to be desired, but did not have any negative impact on the units themselves. Also as noted, it seemed that I was missing the gasket inbetween the manifold and cat, but it was in the box tucked under a flap, so be sure to look everywhere before calling them on it. Installation was a breeze.  Look on youtube and forums for guidance if you are unsure but want to tackle the project. This 2 piece unit was easy to assemble, 4 bolts and done.  Preperation on the rusted surfaces was the key for me.  Began soaking the bolts and nuts every day after work for the 3 days prior to installation.  Luckily did not have any problems.  A sidenote, be sure to undo the first exhaust hanger under the car for easier removal of old unit, also the bracket attached to the cooling fan for the ac line to move the line as you remove unit from the vehicle. This unit is a little thinner so installation much easier than removal. After all said and done, no more check engine light and saved hundreds of dollars-literally.  Ive done over a hundred miles no with no problems, car is actually running much better, idle smoothed out, power band is more evened out.  So far So Great!!!

So, I saved a lot of money. I have no idea what they would have charged for labor either. If I had had them do it, I know the cost would have been exorbitantly high.The valve took me maybe 15 minutes to replace. I used my code scanner to clear the code once I was done.

Installation was much easier than expected; this youtube video was by far the best how-to guide I found ([...]  One item of interest: although several youtube videos and other reviews stated that you had to use the old mounting bracket, I found that the new one worked and the old one didn't (it was pretty obvious the orientation was wrong when I tried to mount the canister with the old bracket).  Subtracted one star because the tube going forward to the vapor canister was formed so that I had to route it below the vapor canister mounting bracket instead of above it as the original was.  Overall, I'm quite satisfied with the quality and ease of install.  Oh, don't forget to order the pigtail connector (ACDelco 19257603 Evaporative Emission Canister Valve Solenoid Jumper Wiring Harness Assembly) when you order the canister vent assembly. \n",

(**Be careful not to overdo the 'frebreeze', it could block the air flow substantially).Been a day since I loaded this filter in, so far so good. If any updates are worthy of sharing, i'll put them here.I recommend this product. \n",

I thought that replacing the external air filter would help and it is when I was at the auto-parts store that I found out that there is actually an interior filter as well but the auto-parts store didn't have this in stock.So I found filters on Amazon that were compatible but for a few bucks more it made sense to me to buy this filter, which by the way, had good reviews. Replacement was extremely easy and the smell is completely gone. Nothing but a nice fresh smell in the car now when driving. \n",

      "Review:  This filter is an exact replacement for the OEM filter.  The filter is a pain to replace the first time, but after you know the trick, you should be able to do it in about 5 minutes.The opening for the filter is less than half the size of the filter, so to install the new one, you have to squeeze it like a fan in the middle, then bow the rigid end on the top to insert it in the opening.  Then push it in, bow the rigid bottom end of the filter, finish pushing it in, let it expand to its form, replace the filter cover, and you are done.The instructions that come with the filter are not useful at all for a 2008 Altima, but they might be accurate for an older model.  The Nissan service manuals instruct you to remove the glove box, but that will make it nearly impossible to reach the opening, so it is counter-productive and unneccessary to do so.My car had 50,000 miles on it when I replaced this cabin filter.  It was disgusting -- almost pure black with dirt, small leaves, and bugs.  I would recommend replacing at least every 25,000 miles.  Nissan recommends replacement every 15,000 miles. \n",

It fit my 2013 Volt perfectly and took less than 5 minutes to install. I also enjoy the added carbon in the filter to catch any odors. Like others mentioned, it does restrict the airflow a bit, but it's not an issues...unless the negotiable amount of mileage lost worries you.
