Shipped really fast.  I've had it about a month now and it is working perfectly.  Pay attention to what size your connection requirement is (width) - .187 or .250 inch.  This is 1/4 inch.,Wrong Size
" The vendor immediately phoned me, listened carefully to the problem, understood the problem (which is very rare today), and promptly mailed the correct fixtures to adapt the 3/8 #34; female lugs that are wired to my Conext Model Up 300 to the 1/4 #34; male lugs which are mounted to the battery.  I could not be happier.  I was made to feel super important.  And unlike practically all other vendors today - there was no attempt to blame it on me.  The response was  #34;all ears #34;, contained very little gratuitous back-chat, and resulted in immediate action.  My day was improved immensely by the way this vendor handled what was actually a very small problem that we could have let slide.  But the simple fact of the matter is that firm, clean, and snug electrical connections are at the heart of safe electronics.  It was indeed possible to make the wiring absolutely correct.  And the vendor made it so.  Yay for 1-800-battery! ",Correct Size/
" This battery does not have F2 terminals. They are F1, and two small converters change the F1 to F2. One converted quickly and easily, the other took some work and pliers. I would have prefered a battery with F2 terminals as this one was described, as I specifically did NOT order a battery with converters. Be careful when you unwrap the package, the converters are small and just loose in the wrapping - took a while to find the second one.  But the battery fits and works well, just wish it was as described. ",Wrong Size
Looked far and wide for this battery as a replacement for a hand lantern. These are exact replacement batteries and fit the lantern. The price for two batteries and shipping was about the same as other vendors for just one battery and its shipping. Now I have a working lantern and a spare battery too.,Correct Size/

works as advertised except for the narrower terminals...have had quantity 2 for over a year in different 750VA TripLite UPSs and both are working well. Tight to install in slots but they fit just like the original ones...will buy again. Delivery was good and on time.  I gave 1 less star because of the narrower terminals. ..just have to squeeze the terminals on the UPSs wire connectors to ensure a tight fit.,Correct Size/
" Nothing special about this one.  This item was purchased as a replacement for a home alarm system.  So far, it has solved the problem with the old battery going dead. ",Correct Size/

" The battery came verry quick, looked and fit like the Harley battery without the Harley name. Cranked over just as good if not better than the original. I saved over 40.00 off the dealer price . ",Correct Size/
This product is priced good but for and stand up electric scooter the battery will not fit standard but with modifications that would range time and money than the battery may fit but would mess up that good deal you got on the batterywith adding on construction value.,Wrong Size.

It was not the exact match. I had to rewire the battery in order to make it work. It was a toy for my Lil man. I am glad that I was able to to make it work.  But make sure you can iuse it.,Wrong Size.
Clips are nowhere near large enough to clamp on a battery. Would not big them again. Have to clip on edges of the terminals which is not idea a risks shorting out your vehicle,Wrong Size.
two different ends on cables. doesn't make sense. had to change the end on one side to fit it to the battery.,Wrong Size.
" I needed a set of jumper cables for my new car and these had good reviews and were at a good price.  They have been used a few times already and do what they are supposed to - no complaints there.What I will say is that 12 feet really isn't an ideal length.  Sure, if you pull up front bumper to front bumper they are plenty long, but a lot of times you will be beside another car or can't get really close.  Because of this, I would recommend something a little longer than 12'.Great brand - get 16' version though. ",Wrong Size
" When the product was being displayed and final purchase being made, there was no mention of it being a 12volt system only. I purchased it for a 24volt jeep and now its only a piece of junk for me. ",Wrong Size.

I bought this to replace my OEM terminal clamps.  This one did not fit at all on the negative battery terminal of a an Optima red top.  The clamp was way too big (like it was made for the positive terminal).  I sent it back to amazon for a refund.,Wrong Size.

" Work at a dealership, charged maybe once every month, clamps a little large   have to leave attached to battery on some vehicles for 30-45 seconds before it will jump off.

I have used my jump-n-carry to jump my car twice this last month during cold weather and even helped to jump start a friends moped.

" I've learned my lesson to just stick with OEM parts for replacements. This wheel bearing for my wifes '05 Saturn Ion 2 was no exception. As usual, the descriptions from ACDelco weren't that great, and I wasn't sure if it should get the bearing with or without the abs sensor. Glad I got the one with the sensor. When I removed the old bearing, the old sensor stuck in the knuckle, and was all gunked up. Popped the old sensor out, cleaned everything up, lubed with never seize, and reassembled. Worked perfect. ",Correct Size/
" I installed this hub.  It turned off my service traction control light, and abs light.  I thought all was good until the bearing starting squealing on the way to the alignment shop.  I torqued the bolts to specs.  I installed a new hub bearing from autozone.  It is having the same problem.  It seems that it wasn't the cause. ",Wrong Size Correct
Defies logic.  Nothing in the ad says they will ship 3 so I ordered two thinking there was one in a box.  Now I have 6 total.  I can't imagine why there would be three.  Two would make some sense.Other than that they are dust caps.  They go round and round with the rotor.  They keep the dust out and the grease in.  Pretty functional overall.,Wrong Size
Surprisingly the product was exactly what was shown. I was worried it wouldn't line up right but they are in and working. I can't say how long they will last but even if it only works for 2 years the savings was worth it.,Correct Size/
I received the part in good shape in a fast and efficient manner. The quality of a Timken bearing was just what I expected.,Correct Size/
this is a good part. autozone/advanced auto priced the wheel bearing alone at over 150 dollars for a chevy cobalt.. plus would have had to pay the labor.. hub and wheel bearing is easier to install and the price on this was over a hundred dollars cheaper!! i rate this 5 stars for sure!!,Correct Size/
" I installed this part on my 2001 Honda Odyssey about a year ago, and it's been working great ever since. The one on the other side is now failing, so I'll be ordering another to complete the pair. The fit and finish were perfect, and it went in without any problems.Update: Side #2 is now installed and working great. With regard to the other reviewer, he could have a point. My van, though, has rear drum brakes, so had no need of holes to hold the rotor in place.For safety, be sure to replace the spindle nut every time, per Honda's factory service manual.

" These are a perfect fit and work great. Easy to install and seem to be durable, only time will tell.These not only fixed the abs issue,but the car ride so much better! ",Correct Size/
No install issues. Works as it should. Let's see how long it lasts. That will be the biggest part of it.,Correct Size/
" I just installed these bearings. They were  #34;snug #34; but fit well. The retaining bolts that hold them were a challenge these are on the backing plate (nothing to do with the new bearings). Make sure you put WD-40 or something like it on the center bolts and the nuts that hold the plate. Made a difference on the car's handling, much tighter (96k on Buick Park Ave). Oh yes, and make sure you tighten the center nut (this one must be really tight). You have to re-use yours, no new one is included, and of course the instructions say to  #34;replace the center hub nut #34;. I tried to buy them locally, and no one has them in stock, you get a new one if you order the whole hub assembly. These bearings from Timkin are the way to go, spend the extra for these so hopefully you don't get to do it again anytime soon.If you don't have a lift rack (I don't) figure about 2 hours a side. After you complete the first one, you will probably improve by 25%. ",Correct Size/
It fit perfectly and installed easily for this back yard mechanic on my 2005 Silverado.  It took be about an hour and a half.,Correct Size/
The bearing seems to fit and function properly. the install was simple I would advise a 2 arm puller on the next attempt. only because of heat and corrosion due to the failed bearing. It was removed in to 2 pieces. It was overdue for replacement.  Seems to be a direct fit replacement part. If any Issues will be in contact in the future. SINCERLY JOHN DOM.,Correct Size/

" The switch I received was great, it works fine. The problem is the listing shows 3 switches, indicates plural in the description yet I only received one switch. A bigger issue is that the listing shows two different switches. Fortunately I needed the one they did send. I contacted the seller and was told that it is just the was the ad runs but it is only for one switch (the one I received). I suggested they correct the ad but it still shows the three switches. The listing is very misleading. ",Wrong Size
I only rated a 4 because it is working perfectly now but time will tell on a converter. It performs well. Just as it is suppose too. Would definitely recommend and buy again! So far so good!,Correct Size/

" It arrives twisted and tied into a knot tighter than the picture shows, no new copper seal washer.  Because it's wound up so tight, probably straight off the assembly line, it's difficult to use.  You have to grab it, untwist it, push on, lube, pull off, then it springs back into a little coil flinging grease all over the place.  Everything I've tried to get it to straighten out doesn't work.  Since you don't get a new copper seal, it leaks there, more grease all over the place.1224 is 24   long, 1230 30  , 1236 36  , 1218 18  .UPDATE:  Fastforward 5 years later, I tried again and ordered another one.  If anything, this one is even worse.  It arrives tied in such a tight knot its like a spring.  This time rather than trying to use it, I returned it.  I'll end up going to my local hose maker to have a custom one made. ",Wrong Size.
" I had read other reviews about the plastic fittings offered by other vendors and to stay away.  When I removed the leaking elbows from the engine I understood why.  Each one snapped off exactly where the O-ring sits.  If you are looking for a short term repair spend a couple dollars less and buy plastic.  If you want to do the job right, buy these aluminum elbows which are unaffected by coolant and the temperature fluctuations of your engine.Simply remove the old elbows which WILL break off, use a small hooked tool (O-ring remover, bent wire, etc) to pull out the small broken plastic pieces, use a round wire brush (similar to one you would use to clean copper pipe prior to soldering) available in the plumbing department to clean out the openings and slip the new aluminum fittings in.  You know have a repair that will outlast the engine.These fittings are ready to go complete with new O-Rings and you cannot beat the price. ",Correct Size/
Ran the item number after I found the part at an online auto supplier. Amazon says it didn't fit my car but I took a chance that the part number was right.

" E46 bmw 330ci. Factory hoses crack and had to replace, saw this price and brought it. worked great once you get it in.

" I hate using after-market parts on my vehicles as they are usually Chinese junk. These are the same OEM ford parts that you buy at the dealer for twice the price.

" Got one of these from Dorman for my 2000 Ford Taurus LX Flex Fuel and it leaked in   exactly   the same spot the broken one did.  Contacted the nice folks at Dorman and they sent me out a replacement. They actually give a darn about their customers!Unfortunately, the replacement was even worse and the hose came apart at exactly the same spot! The nice Dorman representative was apologetic and actually got me an OEM part that was a perfect fit and, drum roll please, did NOT leak!Not sure if Dorman will recall the ones at Amazon, but they are dedicated to standing behind their products and to provide inexpensive but functional replacement products. This problem occurred around November of 2011, in case you're reading this sometime in the future and the problem with the hoses will surely have been remedied. ",Wrong Size

The ACDelco 25528382 Pressure Accumulator is an exact replacement for the original Buick Reatta accumulators. Installation is as simple as installing an oil filter.

I even got free shipping!,Correct Size/
" Take a look.  The bolts are too long and are minimum grade steel.  Even after a short tow, the clamp is too loose to provide stabilization.  I had to re-engineer the bolts with shorter case-hardened bolts, nuts and lock washers.  That helped but the frame is obviously mild steel which stretches and flattens, so I still had to re-tighten them after a 5-hour highway tow.I am now shopping for something better.  Wouldn't buy them again. ",Wrong Size.

" I used to use Toyota OEM pads,  because I'm very conscious about safety and hate the squeaking noise after 10k miles. I had Akebono pads on my 2007 camry. I've put more than 30k on it, there still plenty of pads left on it. I think I can put at least another 15-20k before the next brake service.

" I like the build quality- it gets hot when I plug it in, and the adhesive is seriously sticky.  If you are planning to go off-label and apply it to the sump of a 4-cylinder Lycoming, be advised that you will want at least the next size up.  Overnight use in North Carolina winters brings up my oil temperature around 20 degrees above ambient, and I was hoping for a little more- but of course that's not the fault of this heater.

" I bought this for a 2002 Honda Odyssey. Let me tell you that Amazon parts will check this saying that it will not fit my 2002 Honda Odyssey. If I were you, I will go to the Akebono website directly and search your car model for the right parts. I did this to make sure the pads I buy from Amazon works. I got it installed and everything works great. No noise, squeaks or anything. Just to let everyone know that Akebono manufacture also manufacture the OEM parts for my 2002 Honda Odyssey. When I took the old pads out, and look at the back, there is a serial number that starts with   AK   referring to this break pad. My Odyssey is 90,000 miles and never had a brake change before so it still had the old original. So this pad may be better or the same as OEM. Also to let everyone know this is manufactured in the USA. Says so on the box, so it is quality brand I will trust for now on. I used Duralast brakes for my other vehicles from Autozone, and they were not good. I will buy this brand for now on on all my vehicles. This brake pad is for the front. ",Wrong Size

I elected to proactively replace them to prevent any wear/tear on my rotors... but was surprised when I removed them and found that there was easily  #62;50% left after about 50K miles.

Seriously worth a look if you need a reliable and great-performing brake pad. ",Correct Size/
I really like these pads. There is a coating on the back side to keep em' quiet. No need to put expensive silicone grease on the back side. The ceramic pad broke in fast and should last a long time. I put them on a 2000 Mercury Sable and they fit up real nice.Bob,Correct Size/

" Compared to the price the dealer wanted for pads, this is a steal. I bought the rotors and pads, had my mechanic install them and saved myself over $400 over what the dealer wanted to charge. It is a crime the way car dealers and some brake shops rip people off for simple repairs. I have no problem with them making a buck, but marking labor and parts up 400% is just not right. How many naive drivers are throwing money away every day because they do not realize how simple and inexpensive brake work is. If I would have had the time, I would have installed them myself. It took the mechanic less than an hour for rotors and pads, probably would have taken me twice that, but I would have saved even more. I just don't like predator pricing. Anyway, the mechanic was very impressed with the quality and the price of the pads. I've been stopping smoothly, quietly and quickly ever since! ",Correct Size/

" Bought this to change the front brakes on my 2005 VW Jetta. Never had used one before and had it figured out in a couple minutes, very solid construction, good quality metal. First piston I tried to compress took some effort but the tool never skipped a beat, didn't slip or falter. Second piston squeezed in like a breeze. Why mess around with C clamps when you can pick this wonderful tool up for $35~ and not damage your car or hands! Looked at cheaper products but leary of cheap knobs breaking off, this tool is all steel, and the high quality handle should last me a lifetime of home brake changes.

" I'm going to purchase this tool because I needed it yesterday. I've never had to deal with these type of brake calipers in the past and was at a loss when my C-clamp wouldn't compress the caliper in. My local Hyundai dealer called me about my other vehicle that was in the shop for more serious repair when I told him I was working on my other Hyundai and couldn't get the rear calipers compressed. He was happy to tell me how to use a pair of needle nose pliers to help screw them in. I will say it was so difficult to keep the pliers spread apart to fit the slots and I kept loosing my grip. It was so frustrating and I ended up adding a couple objects (washers) in between the handle to keep it from closing and then securing the object in place with a rubber band. This made it easy to use the pliers without fumbling them. I did have to take off the bleeder valve cover on the caliper and the reservoir cover to allow it to screw in easily and even had to back it out a couple times to get them to screw all the way in. Not sure why I had to screw them OUT to get them IN but it worked. Anyway, after dealing with that I decided that I will be purchasing a tool next time to make it easier and I think this tool will do the trick. I don't really care if it's precision made like another commenter said it needed to be. Hey, as long as it makes it easy to wind them back in right? If my needle nose pliers can get them in why wouldn't these tools?Here is what my caliper looks like [...] ",Wrong Size

" I  had forgotten to write a review of this pond. I put it in last fall and have really enjoyed it. I too had a frog move in right away . It survived the winter here in Upstate NY and was sitting by the pond all Spring. That frog left on the 4th of July and now two little ones have moved in. I painted the waterfall a silvery color and over the winter (I left it out not knowing where the frog was hibernating) it weathered to a nice natural look.It was very easy to put in  and the pump continues to work with no problems other than an easy cleaning which was described in the literature that came with the kit.

" Pros - Good stainless construction.  Stainless banjo fittings and the kit comes with all new hardware.  New bolts, copper washers, and clips.Cons - Hoses don't have an outer protective casing like some higher end hoses.  The kit says the hoses are slightly longer than stock to allow you to run the hoses where you want which lets the hose rub against the upper arm.Overall I would buy these hoses again for my application.  However if your project is for more show than go, skip these and go for a little more money for a set of coated hoses. ",Correct Size/
" The Line is of high quality and the length is correct. My only issue is with the brass fitting that mates the hose to the brake line in the vehicle.

I considered returning the large adapter due to the fact the small adapter's diameter very close to the large - and was more than big enough for my brake master cylinder.  In fact - the small adapter was almost too big for my clutch master cylinder.  This is when the biggest design flaw of the small adapter became clear - the seal does little to prevent leaks.The seal design of the small adapter is inferior when compared to the large adapter (flat seal vs a slightly conical seal on the large adapter).  The difference was not clear until I tried to bleed my brakes with the small adapter and fluid leaked out everywhere - with the adapter properly clamped down - and reset several times, and eventually clamped down as tight as it could be clamped.  The result was the same (on both the brake and clutch master cylinder) - severe leaks and a horrible mess.  And may I remind everyone that brake fluid is not the kind of substance you want leaked - least of all on a painted surface.The other unfortunate flaw with the adapter I received is one of the screw-down posts (threaded post that links to the chain) would not thread into the knurled knob due to the threads being stretched.  Fortunately, my purchase of the large adapter gave me a working set.I am not happy with this purchase and do not recommend it.  The large adapter still leaked slightly, but at a much more manageable rate and is suitable for the Honda S2000 brake master cylinder.  The large adapter is too large for the clutch master cylinder.

" Overall, this kit worked for my 2004 Toyota Sequoia. All of the springs and hold-down parts seemed to be an exact match of what I had on my car. However, for some reason it seems that they skimped on the adjuster. There are three parts to the adjuster -- the star adjuster itself, the screw-in saddle, and the saddle with a stud. The stud was way too short, maybe 1/4 inch, and was very hard to hold into place when trying to place the adjuster between the brake shoes. After wrestling with it for 10 minutes, I just decided to pitch it and reuse the one that was already there. The stud on that one was about 1/2 inch, and was plenty long to keep it in place. It's very hard to see the part in the photo -- it looks like they might have stood the saddles on the studs, which makes it impossible to see how long they are. ",Wrong Size.

 This product is great for the price but after i had put mine on the brake it didn't fit over my accelerator. I drive a 96 silverado which is an insanely popular model so i think   universal   is a pretty inaccurate description and from the looks of the other reviews it doesn't fit either. they also squeak against shoes when they're wet and the screws might come loose but they are a pretty cheap product ,Wrong Size

 I bought these for my 2010 F150 along with the brake pads. The pads fit but these rotors did not. I used the Amazon parts finder that told me these were correct. At 1st glance the diameter is correct but the bolt pattern was wrong. The product may be just great but if they don't fit I can't judge. So my review gives 3 stars because they are the wrong size. Of course I had the truck pulled apart before I noticed. Then I had to run into town and buy the correct rotors from the local NAPA store at 5PM on a Saturday. I read online that the Ford caliper pins don't   float   well so the rotors don't get even wear. One blog site said the NAPA pins are better and correct this issue so I ordered those from NAPA and installed. Getting the rotor off was also a challenge. The F150 users site had a video showing how to use    bolts and the caliper bracket to   press them off  . It worked great look it up.I like the pads.

bought this cable along with a new mikuni 30mm vm roundslide. the cable did hook into the mikuni carb but as i routed it up the bike i realized that it was only 30'' long and got nowhere near reaching my twist throttle. i would say this product is far from universal. if your buying the carb you will have better luck having a cable made at a local store. most motorcycle/atv dealers will have the ability to do this for you.,Wrong Size

I even sprayed the cable with silicone lube and it did not make a difference.,Wrong Size Correct
The ones I received were slightly different than the picture here but in a good way. They have a shrink-wrap covering over where the cable goes into the crimp-on metal connector.

" Like other's have stated, this Stant #10504Y (Yellow) locking Gas Cap did not come up as compatible with my vehicle, but the Stant #10504 (Black) Gas Cap did show compatible.  I figured that Stant used the same part number with the (Y) to designate the Yellow E-85 Locking Gas Cap.  So I ordered the yellow cap as my Terrain came with an original Yellow Gas cap since it can use E-85.  I have never put E-85 in my vehicle, but wanted to keep things a near as original as possible.  I have had the locking Gas cap on for 5 days now and NO check engine light has come on what so ever driving the vehicle every day now. I have even put gas in the vehicle since installing the locking cap.  Like other's have mentioned, it would have been nice to have some sort of lanyard attached to the locking cap, like my original one did, but every vehicle uses different methods for attacking the lanyard and it would be difficult for the manufacture to come up with a universal way of securing the lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  It would have been nice if the gas cap had some sort of eyelet that a lanyard could be threaded through.  I have a great lanyard from one of my iPad stylus pens I don't use that would be perfect for attacking to the gas door and the gas cap if there was a eyelet to secure the lanyard to.  I'm sure not going to drill a hole in the gas cap to thread the lanyard through.  To me this isn't a end of the world issue so I am NOT downgrading the rating because there was no lanyard.  If you look at all the locking gas caps, here on Amazon, you won't find but one or two that have a lanyard.  Maybe someday the manufactures come up with a good universal way to secure a lanyard to the vehicle gas door.  So for now I am pleased with my purchase. ",Wrong Size Correct

" As far as overflow bottle caps go, this one is one of the better built in a sea of copycat units.  Mine was built in Germany, but your mileage may vary.  The cheap China-built units, that are basically thrown in with the overflow bottle replacement kits, look identical from the outside, but are assembled different.  This cap will not fall apart after a few heatings and coolings in your Jeep Cherokee vehicle.  It is rated to factory 16-pounds, and you must not be tempted to use a Volvo 22 pound substitute cap instead.  Yes, those caps are superior strength in design, but the extra pressure will encourage your engine to blow out the hoses during a hot drive, and that is a catastrophic failure, not merely an annoying leak at the overflow bottle that you can wait out at the side of the road.  Suggestion:  Due to a design flaw in Jeep Cherokee overflow bottle design, WRAP your T-35  #34;Radiator #34; Cap with three heavy duty tie wraps with the binding heads separated by 120 degrees in a circle.  Or, buy an inexpensive, stainless steel 2.25 #34;-4 #34; range hose clamp and wrap that around the center of the T-35.  That will prevent radiator fluid steam heat from damaging and distorting the cap over time.  Future leaking and replacements averted! ",Wrong Size.
" Back in October of 2012 I knocked out my ambient temp sensor on my '00 528i while driving over a piece of tire on the highway on my way to work, and although I did not know what had happened that morning I figured it out on my way home that same day when the heat really kicked in and my A/C did not work.  Needless to say I was skeptical about buying this item as with most things I suppose, you really need to just stop overthinking things and decide what you want to do.

Approximately 10 minutes later, I taped up the wires and repositioned the sensor so it was out of harm #8217;s way and connected the battery lead back on and I fired up my car with the very missed +96 on my display instead of -40 and cold air for the first time in almost 9 months.

In my 97 Blazer, there is a mounting tab, welded on to the power steering neck. This mounting tab is secured by a small bolt, that was attached to the original compressor. When you get this pulley bypass plate, it does not have a hole, to mount this filler neck to, so you are left with sandwiching the filler neck, mounting plate, in between the bottom of the pulley plate, and the top of the existing compressor bracket.

" Everything fit great except the transmission cooler line fittings, which were a bear.  The paperwork says make sure you don't cross-thread those fittings, which is understandable -- but even when lined up correctly the cooler line thread units would not fit into the new fittings, especially the bottom one.  Trying to hand tighten these?  Forget it.  The bottom fitting I couldn't even push the thread unit in far enough to engage the threads in the fitting.  I eventually took the fittings off my old radiator and put them into the new radiator, and then the lines went right in.  I'm sure that voided my warranty, but at that point I just had to get it done. ",Wrong Size
" This is a good replacement for your radiator. The seller is great, they shipped the radiator fast, and I got it on time.The only problem is that a connection piece with an internal o-ring was missing or was not provided (on the lower part of the radiator).

" The product is fine. The last one I ordered lasted about a year and a half. It is not high quality, but it does the job. It might be worth having an extra one on hand for when it fails.This is my first concern about Amazon shipping. Normally, I receive the product the day scheduled. This time ONTRAC got it all the way to my home town on a Friday and it appears that they put it on the wrong truck. It was not delivered, Saturday, Sunday or Monday(holiday).

" First of all, during installation I notice the gasket was different from the factory one on the car. I revisit the site and saw that the rubber gasket it showed was different from the one I got with the package. It was smooth all around without the 2 inner tabs that you see in the picture. What you see in the picture is the same as the one I pulled off the car. Since I spent all this time pulling out the thermostat, I decided to use the old gasket with the new thermostat since it still looked good and still soft. I did not wanted to take the chance having it leak. Now driving around and looking at my temperature gauge, it look the same as before!! I end up exchanging emails with pictures to be sure I got the right product. Long story short after a few emails they came back and said it is correct and rated for 10 degrees C lower and asked if I wanted to return it. I keep it because I did not have the time to pull it out. I would not buy it for my 2nd Honda like I though I would have. ",Wrong Size.

" the bmw 850 pump requires a water hose nipple on the bottom front of the pump, what they sent was most likely a pump for a bmw 750 which does not require the hose nipple. this was not amazons fault! either bosch or the company that makes the pump put the wrong item in the box. I had the same prolbem with a gmb pump, so it most likely is a manufactures screw up. I finally got the correct pump when I ordered a beck arnley. ",Wrong Size
" If you have a small leak, I would recommend pulling the pump before you order.  I assumed leak was a weep hole from much research, does not exist on mine.  Turned out to be gaskets.  If you have a gasket leak buy gaskets or use perma-tex with the old metal one.  Gasket rubber on the metal breaks down and allows leakage. 80k mi/9 yrs. 5.3L.  Don't forget to check belts while it is apart. FULLY SATISFIED with purchase and NOT CHINESE.  I also purchased Pump Inlet 15-011057,comes with thermostat.

This is a quality made product. My engine sounds great and I'm getting an average of 1.5 mpg better than my stock intake.I did have to drill out the anchor hole on the bottom as it didn't quite line up. Also use the factory anchor screw. It's much better.,Correct Size/
" Excellent quality and easy to install as it requires 20 minutes a lot, gives an excellent performance and saves on fuel consumption with something simple. ",Correct Size/
" Installation was relatively easy, especially considering I am not a   car guy   at all. It took me about an hour but, again, I have no experience working on engines, etc. other than to change the oil and simple maintenance-type jobs. Even a semi-experienced person could probably have the old intake out and the new one installed in about 20 minutes. With a small socket set, a screwdriver and/or a cordless drill, this can be done with little or no problems. The one suggestion I would make to people installing this (or if I had it to do over again) is that I would go ahead and attach the breather hose to the Volant vent BEFORE the vent is installed, as it is a very snug fit and can be a little awkward to fit on once the vent is installed. Everything else was a piece of cake.I read some reviews that the Volant instructions weren't very good but I found them to be very clear and concise (although, b/c of my ignorance, I had to search online to make sure I was unscrewing the MAF sensor and not something else)...Packaging and shipping were great (I got mine in 2 days for free with my Amazon Prime membership).Now, the results...it definitely makes acceleration a little   throatier   than before but it's not obnoxious. I was worried that my truck might sound like a Harley with the new intake but that's not the case. It is a bit louder at the top end of acceleration than I planned for but, even still, not obnoxious. It sounds tough. My truck now has a noticeable increase in acceleration, which is what I bought it for. It's too early to tell the impact, if any, on gas mileage but I've read and heard consistently that it will give you an extra 1-1/2-3 MPG increase, which is always nice. Would definitely recommend.

" I specifically ordered this  #34;Anchor #34; brand mount based on positive feedback on the Piloteers forum.  What I received was a mount with the same model number but, had a different manufacturers label and no mention of Anchor brand.  After initially panicking, I was scheduled to install the next day, I contacted Anchor and confirmed that these were indeed rebranded Anchor motor mounts.  As for the quality, fit and finish - The fit was good and they installed with little difficulty.  The quality appeared to be similar to the original equipment although, I noticed some defects in the paint which already had signs of rust.  Not perfect but, I received them quickly due to Prime and saved a ton of $ over the cost of the Honda original equipment replacement.  I replaced the passenger side mount at the same time and my review for that mount is exactly the same as this.  Tip: If you decide to DIY the motor mounts on your Pilot / Ridgeline or Passport, make sure you are prepared to replace all of the small plastic molding clips that hold on the splash shield under the front bumper.  The small ones are brittle and are not designed to be removed and reinstalled.  order a pack of these: http://www.amazon.com/Push-type-Fastener-91503-SZ3-003-Element-Ridgeline/dp/B00842A7F4/ref=sr_1_3?s=automotive ie=UTF8 qid=1395075816 sr=1-3 keywords=91512-sx0-003.  You'll only need about 14 or so but, they are cheaper in bulk.  There are 3 or 4 larger clips which you might be able to carefully removed without breaking but, mine were brittle and I cracked a couple of them.  The Honda part number is 91503-sz5-003.  Good luck!

" Chrome Valve Cover - The Amazon site stated that the Chrome Valve Cover would fit my 225 slant six engine.  It fits, but is not a stock application.  This valve cover only has two holes, the stock valve cover has three holes...1 for the oil cap, 1 for the breather cap, and 1 for the pcv valve.  If I use the chrome valve cover I cannot use the stock breather cap, and must use an after market push-on cap in order to have an access hole to put in oil.  Using this type of breather cap reqiuires either plugging the line from the air cleaner or purchasing an after-market custom air cleaner that also won't support the stock fresh air intake.  Unless you are willing to make several custom alterations, I suggest staying with a stock valve cover.  One other thing, the two holes in the chrome valve cover aren't the same size as the ones in the stock valve cover, so plan to buy new grommets also. ",Wrong Size

Learned the job would go a lot smoother by removing the exhaust at the block.  It was three bolts on either side of the block, the hangar bolt, and then the two spring bolts in the rear which broke due to rust so for $11 just get them ahead of time just in case.  Makes removing the old cat from the exhaust header so much easier not to mention reattaching the new one back on to the header.  If you do it this way you'll want to get two new exhaust header gaskets in addition to the front gasket and the rear donut gasket for the new cat.

The only reason to pay more for a filter [system] would be to spend it on a cold air intake, and that's a whole different matter.*This filter fits VERY snugly, which is good because you want a good seal and don't want to let any air pollutants/particles into the engine.Get this filter for your car, wallet, and your OEM-craving-sake.And you can trust all Mann filters for sure.

Have relocation kit installed and I am glad I do not have to go through the long oil changes anymore.  The install went smooth the only issue I had was due to my after-market exhaust.  My exhaust required that I re-position the rear brake reservoir and unfortunately it was in the way of where the oil filter sits on the relocation kit.  Other than that it looks good and replacement oil filters are easy to obtain.  I like this kit better then some of the others because the fittings for the oil lines are more secure and there is no annoying logo displayed.,Correct Size/

" ThisTYC Cabin Air Filter for Nissan Pathfinder (2005-2008)seems to be an adequate substitute for the OEM filter, and considerably cheaper. A set of two (required) was only $16.99. However, it apparently is made slightly wider than necessary, and therefore is a royal pain to fit into the filter cavity in the AC system.The first filter slides in pretty easily. Once in, it must be slid to the right beyond the cavity opening in order to insert the second filter . . . far easier said than done due to its slightly oversized dimensions. The filter must be mashed a bit, which deforms its edges. I suspect that creates air flow gaps between the two filters. I say   suspect,   because once the filters are inserted, they can't be seen. The OEM filters I removed were somewhat deformed as well, so perhaps this isn't a relevant issue.My only other concern is that, compared to the OEM filter, this one appears to have 20-30% fewer pleats. Although that likely permits freer air flow, it also probably filters less effectively. ",Wrong Size.

" Bought this filter before reading the commentary on the web.  Had always thought Fram was a reliable brand made by a division of the Honeywell Corporation, but numerous questions raised by bloggers.  Turns out Honeywell sold the division to an Australian company in 2011, and the quality does seem questionable.  After splitting off the can top from the filter base, I found the filter media to have the manufacturing flaws noted in the blogs.  There was a large gap where the paper media was supposed to be joined around the steel core, and the end-caps were indeed made of loose-fitting cardboard.  Now more curious, I bought another model number at a local auto parts (PH3569) and opened it.  This filter was very well made with a tight, dense, even fitting media and steel end-caps.  If you use a lot of filters and can get a good price on Fram, you might open and examine the type you use to see if it's the better quality.  Hopefully, Fram is making the effort to improve all the types, regardless of where they are manufactured/sourced. ",Wrong Size

" The coarse sandpaper finish on this is awesome - even tough places you can twist this off with a hand rather than a wrench, even if it's covered in oil.

" This tool works, but I found it a bit clumsy.  It is two bits in one.  A slot bit, which fits the recessed Quadrajet idle mixture screws.  the other end is an open hex socket for the other type of mixture screw.  At the back of each socket is a square base that fits up into a small rubber handle.  You push the end you are not going to use up inside of this rubber handle and the square base fits in so when you turn the handle the tool turns.  This square base barely fits into the handle and is loose and kept falling out.  Right when you are concentrating on how many turns you find you are not turning the tool at all because this tool has fallen out of the handle.  It only falls out far enough to stop turning.  the tool but if you don't see this and keep turning the handle, as the very end of the tool stays in but with not grip so you are turning nothing but the handle.  I finally discarded the handle and just used my fingers to turn the square base, or knob, that is attached to the socket.  The shaft is a flex cable, which makes it nice for tight places or reverse work like I had to do, as this was a motorhome so I had to work on the adjustments from the rear of the carb.  It worked but the handle was a joke.  I could have used some electrician tape and solved the problem.  It is a small tool, the socket ends about a 1/4 #34; dia.  the square bases about 3/8 #34; and the 2.5 inch foam, rubber type handle about 1/2 #34; dia.  May 7 #34; - 8 #34; in length.

" I don't know how much more involved pulling the fuel pump from the original housing would have been, but replacing the entire housing with the fuel pump already installed sure did make this an easy 'pull-and-drop' installation. ** UPDATE: See below **The reason I changed the entire housing is because I have an 04 Sentra SE-R Spec V and there was a Nissan service bulletin (NTB05-052a) which was a fuel-pump repair kit. The repair kit itself was over $200 from the dealer, plus my fuel pump was not maintaining adequate pressure, so not only was this easier to install, but also saved me quite a bit of money as well.I didn't want to install the Nissan-branded fuel pump because it is known to have issues and need replacing every ~60K miles. I went with Bosch for ease of installation and company reputation.I recommend this kit if you have an 04-06 Sentra and have been plagued with any kind of hard-starting issue and/or fuel pressure issue that might be observed by a drop in engine RPMs.** UPDATE: you will have to do a bit of wiring since the new fuel pump housing does NOT include the Fuel Temperature Sensor, although it is shown in the picture (at the very bottom of the fuel pump housing (Blue and Black wires). The housing comes bare and also with no instructions! It's definitely misleading since the picture clearly shows the Temperature sensor in-place. If you're getting the P0183 after installation, this is your issue. Transfer the Fuel Temp Sensor over from your old Fuel Pump housing and your code should be cleared and not return. I threw my old housing away too soon and had to pick up the part from the Junk Yard-- 35 miles away! Hard lesson learned.*** 2nd UPDATE: I contacted Bosch AutoPart Customer Service and was able to talk with a Bosch parts specialist: The Bosch 69701 Electric Fuel pump does NOT have support for CA emissions, hence the lack of Fuel Tank Temp Sensor. The 69701 is only made for Federal Emissions vehicles. Therefore Bosch does not supply the Fuel Tank Temperature Sensor and 69701 is actually not compatible with my 04 Sentra SE-R Spec V.

This fuel pump arrived earlier than expected and was nearly $50 cheaper than my local auto parts store.Installation on my 2000 Windstar was pretty smooth.  I purchased an adjustable oil filter wrench that look like channel locks to unscrew the unit from the top of the tank.  Make sure to get the o-ring in place along with the gasket to prevent leakage.  And make sure the old o-ring is on the old pump and not still on the gas tank or it's going to be impossible to press the new pump into place.  The wiring harness was an exact fit and everything worked perfectly the first time and that's how we like it!It's been on for only 2 months so I'm not sure of the longevity just yet.,Correct Size/
" After looking on the Delco website and checking the listing for this pump I bought it to install on my 78 GMC 454 truck. Being an inline pump, installation is as easy as it gets, and I also installed an inline filter just before this pump. My first test drive was a let down because the engine hesitated and cut out several times over the course of 20 minutes. Back at home, I pulled the fuel line and found that the pump was only dribbling gas. I replaced it with a Carter pump and all is good now. It could be that I received a defective pump, not sure, but I wasn't taking any chances with a replacement Delco.Also, the pump photo on Amazon is not correct.

" This was an exact replacement fuel pump for my wife's 2005 Ford Five Hundred.  Relatively easy installation as Ford provided an access panel under the back seat.

I also replaced the fuel pressure sending unit which is located on the   fuel rail   to the fuel injectors.  I'm not positive which one of these parts addressed the intermittent stalling and refusal to restart.  My wife is handicapped so didn't want to gamble on stranding her another time.

This item does what it designed for well.  The reason for the 3 stars is that the threads in the aluminium clamps are threaded into a hole that is too big and the outcome is a stripped thread when I did the thumb screws up when I used it for the first time.

" I wanted to buy this BCM because it's an ACDelco product and 1/2 the price of the one sold at the auto dealer's parts department.  Before I purchased this BCM, I checked the part number with the auto dealer to make sure it was a direct replacement for my original BCM ... and it was.  So I purchased it.  I took it to an authorized Saturn Service Center to program and install it.  After 1-1/2 hours, the service technicians gave up.  This BCM could not be programmed.  It would not communicate with the programming equipment.  The problem wasn't with the Service Center's programming equipment because my old BCM connected to it just fine so they can download the vehicle VIN number and mileage to be transferred to the new BCM.

" I received this antenna as a gift, so I didn't personally purchase this through Amazon.Installation is really easy after you do all the necessary cleaning and prep (alcohol wipe down to remove the wax).1. Just unscrew the original antenna off the mount.2. Tape the alignment guide on your car.3. Attach the helix wire with the provided screw.4. Remove the cover of the 3M double sided tape and place the shark fin (Beat-Sonic calls it a Dolphin antenna) cover down over the factory antenna base and between the cutout in the alignment guide and press down to make the cover stick on your roof.Simple as that.  It took me about 10 minutes.It's painted to match the original color of your car so the installation looks factory and cool.  But.......you do lose some antenna gain.  I tuned onto popular local AM stations (for those of you in the Los Angeles area, the stations I used were KNX 1070 and 790 KABC) during installation.  When I made the connection as described in step 3 above, the radio reception was just as good as the factory antenna.  This was a dry test fit, so I didn't remove the cover of the double sided tape.  As I was lowering the fin cover over the factory base (step 4) I started to lose the signal (more static).  I removed my hand just to make sure my body wasn't blocking any of the signal, but no improvement.  I lifted the fin cover off and the signal came back.  Bottom line, the shark fin cover is not totally RF transparent and you are going to lose signal.If you live in a major city, this may not be an issue.

Unfortunately, the sunlight totally washed out the GPS screen, and since the angle of the mount is not adjustable, there wasn't anything I could do to make the screen easier to see. Had to keep the GPS balanced in the cupholder. It would have been great to have a few different angle adjustments to minimize this problem. I've dropped my rating down to 3 stars.___Original review - In California, until recently it was illegal to mount a GPS (or anything else) on the windshield. That meant that you either needed to affix a GPS mount to the dashboard, possibly marring the surface over time, or deal with the slipping and sliding of a loose unit as you drove. I was in the latter camp, and ended up putting the GPS in the cup holder more often than not, occasionally picking it up to make sure I was heading in the right direction.I actually spent quite a bit of time looking for solutions to this problem. Believe it or not, no one seemed to make a non-adhesive GPS mount for the dashboard. I tried a beanbag for a while, but this was obviously not the best solution (people gave me funny looks when they saw a Beanie Baby on my dashboard).This mount by Heininger is exactly what I was looking for. It is a molded soft foam/latex frame which has a grippy bottom to keep everything in place on your dashboard, an angled design to keep the GPS at a good viewing angle, and an open back in case you have cords to attach to the GPS. Most importantly, once you get to your destination you can just throw the mount on the floor so that no one knows you have a GPS unit in your car.The only significant downside is that since there is technically nothing that is keeping your GPS unit in place except gravity, sudden turns or stops/starts can potentially cause the GPS unit to tumble out of the mount. As long as that doesn't fit your driving style, this mount should work well for you. Also, it is somewhat on the large side, which allows a widescreen GPS to fit nicely in it, but it may be too big for some smaller units, such as the TomTom One. ",Wrong Size
" I installed two of these in my 4x4 and they work great.  Very easy to hook up and no problems running devices with them.  I've still got two more that I plan to hook up in the back cargo area, but haven't found the time.  I don't expect any problems when I do besides getting power back there.I took away one star because the 'cover' doesn't work great with the 'mounting plate' (it works, but only in a very specific setup).

" I have been having intermittent problems with the headlights on my '99 Subaru Impreza. For a while, I thought it was the cheap 9003 bulbs that I have been buying. The problem turned out to be the original headlight socket. The plastic housing for the socket was brittle and appeared burned out.Purchase these Dorman sockets and swapped out the old ones. Work just fine. I noted the the wiring colors on these sockets are different from the wiring colors my vehicle. I used a VOM to make sure that the wiring is connected correctly.I highly recommend this product. BTW, one pack comes with 2 sockets. ",Correct Size/

" I don't know how you make such a great product that is mostly unusable unless you know how to splice electrical wiring.  I took this out of the package and visually inspected it, and thought, wow this is really built well.  I inserted a lighter type plug into it and it locked in like it would never let go.  I looked at the length and thought, well, it seems OK to me for my little Honda CBR500R.  Now the mistake I made was thinking I had enough handlebar to mount this, which I don't.  My fault.  So I decided to hang it on a wire bundle leaving the left handle bar.  Routing it virtually straight back to the battery, it *just* made it.  It wouldn't have from the handle bar, and certainly not from anywhere I might have chosen to drill a hole for mounting in the fairing.  This is made so damn well I just can't understand for the life of me why they didn't put an extra 12 #34; of length on it.  Someone screwed the pooch here.  This is working for me, but I don't like the way I had to mount it and I'll undoubtedly go back and relocate it, which will mean splicing the wires, which I know how to do.  So it works, but I'll still have to put in another hour or so to get it where it doesn't look jacked.  Oh, and this is to power my GPS. ",Wrong Size.

" Took only about a half hour to mount these on the upper cab of my older John Deere 955 which I use to plow and blow snow. What a difference!  The light from two of these lights is at least five times that of the cheap halogens I had previously mounted on my tractor cab. They are GREAT, white and bright and use almost no current.  The older 955 has a small alternator and now it will no longer have to suffer running the two 30W halogens I was using. Additionally, two of these is more affordable than buying any of the available light bars I had found on the web.. I highly recommend these and dearly hope they last, they are worth every penny paid. Thanks Amazon for offering them. Assembling the brackets to the light  takes longer than mounting the lights. The trick is to just drop that nut in the slot and let the bolt threads find their home. Otherwise, you can fuss with these for nothing. ",Correct Size/

" Didnt want to spend like 300+ dollars on a Rigid Industries LED bar if I could get a quality one at a decent price, and this one fits the bill.  Just mounted it to my brush gaurd in place of 2 little 55w Baja Halogen lights which were a pain since they would bounce around a little on nasty potholes and it really sucks getting 2 spotlight beams to perfectly align all the time.  Havent used it at night but im waiting til it gets dark and ill update the review.  Having an older 2nd gen 4runner with a brush guard in front of the headlights really sucks for visibility at night, even with those Baja lights on its still hard to see far enough ahead when your going 50+ mph.  Anyways this unit seems really well built, has solid cast aluminum mounts with rubber bushings to keep it from vibrating.  No harness so we installed a Delphi Weatherpack kit (about $6) for a true plug   play setup, not to mention it looks really professional and clean with the harness and shrink wrap.  When buying LED fixtures for off road they should have a MINIMUM IP rating of 64,  RIGID INDUSTRIES I think are IP68,  these are very close at IP67:The two numbers in the IP67 rating code rating refer to:6 -    Dust Protected   ; Totally protected against dust ingress.; complete protection against contact7-    Immersion Protected   ; Protected against short periods of immersion in water.Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion). Test duration: 30 minutes;  Immersion at depth of at least 1 m measured at bottom of device, and at least 15 cm measured at top of deviceSo unless your mounting these to your underwater submarine they should do just fine under normal, and by normal I mean severe off road, conditions.  Odds are if these LED's stop working because of water damage you'll probably be getting a new vehicle too.  God help anybody who cuts me off at night now! ",Correct Size/

It's a little confusing that they didn't come with any product information card, warranty info, or printed instructions, though I did find instructions in a PDF here at Amazon. Installation took 15 minutes for both struts and required only a 10mm driver and a flat head screwdriver.What an improvement! The gate rises gently after it's opened more than 6  . It's a tad stiff to pull down to close, but I'll take that over being bopped in the head. ",Correct Size/
The struts were replacements for the original equipment that had failed due to age. The new struts were delivered as promised and performed as expected.,Correct Size/
Very good product! Very quick delivery too! It's actually the third one I've prurchased. The only thing I'd change is the rate in which the tailgate lowers. On my GMC Sierra it's a little too fast. On my Ford F150 it was slower.,Correct Size/
" The tail gate on my 2003 PT Cruiser Limited Edition was not staying up reliably and was very hard to open. The final straw was when the tail gate fell on my wife's arm, badly bruising her upper arm. I guess we were lucky it didn't hit her in the head and knock her down.I bought a pair of these lifts and they exceeded my expectations. NOTE: You will need a 40 Torx driver (six pointed) to remove the old lifts and install the new ones. You will also need someone to hold the tail gate up for you during the process. The process of removing the old lifts and installing the new ones is easy and takes only 15 minutes, or so.After the new lifts were installed, the tail gate not only stays up, it is much easier to open. Now the tail gate opens with only minimum effort. In fact, once started, it practically opens itself. I am extremely pleased with these lifts and I expect they will perform for some years to come.

" Same quality as stock, at least, on my 2003 Honda Element. This is no joke: it took me longer to read the instructions on how to install them than it did to install them (the instructions aren't crystal clear but they're pretty good; once you figure out how to release the old ones it's probably about as difficult as replacing a gas cap). Less than four minutes and I had both units replaced. Didn't need an assistant, just opened the hatch, used a screwdriver to release the catch and pop the top and bottom ends off. Closed the hatch while I grabbed the replacement unit, opened the hatch, popped it in place. Then repeated for the other side. The new strut had enough oomph to hold the hatch by itself. The only   complaint   is that the hatch is harder to close, slightly. Much offset by the fact that I don't bump my forehead anymore. Definitely worth the money. ",Correct Size/
" Replaced the leaking, broken strut on my 2006 Audi A4 Quattro SLine perfectly. Took 8 minutes to install total. 2 minutes to remove the old one, 1 minute to install this one, and 5 minutes to find something to hold the 45 lb hood open so I could use both hands. Perfect fit.

" After a tedious Manual installation, with Help from my Dad and about 30-40 minutes we both got 2 of them working on my Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4... WHICH requires 2 in order to function right, good thing I did order two, because after getting one old support off, the door tried to slam on me.Once I got both on, the tightness was epic, and it even makes the lift-gate auto rise after the gate is halfway up. it hold the gate up really good, I have to put a good amount of pressure on it to get it back down..

" Came on time and was packed well. Swapping them out was a breeze: all you need is a screwdriver to pop the clip out of your old ones to take them off. The new ones just click right in.

These are plenty strong and were relatively easy to install using a flat head screw driver to hold the clip open.  The hardest part is getting the old one of because you somehow have to hold the hood up while changing out the first one.  I used the top of my head.  While extremely uncomfortable for a few minutes its possible for an able bodied 25 yr old man.  If you are weaker I would ask for an extra set of hands.  Once you get one side on the single strong arm will hold my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee hood open.  It will still need to be slightly supported to prevent the hood from sagging until the new one gets put on the other side.,Correct Size/
" These worked great! I bought a 2008 Jeep Commander used and when I got it the trunk part would slowly fall until I couldn't stand under it, which at my height is saying something.

" Received the supports earlier but waited for warm day to install. The OEM ones be replaced were pretty worn out. The Strong Arm replacements were simple to install however they don't work like I expected. When i release the trunk, it barely opens. When i close the trunk by hand, there's a spot about 1/3 closed where it takes much more effort to overcome?? Seems like they need an adjustement?? ",Wrong Size.

" I installed a pair of westin tubes almost 10 years ago.  After they rusted off, I got the aluminum sure step and this installation kit.  Probably the worst instructions I have ever seen.  Seriously, how hard is it to write some decent instructions. I could spend 10 minutes and write a better set of instructions.  After you get one side done, you figure it out.  The worst offense is that the brackets aren't engineered to fit correctly.  The bracket will bend the lower lip of the sheet metal as you tighten down the bolts.  It should have been at 90 degrees, but it is at about 80 degrees so the thin metal is stressed.  The bolts are barely big enough to get threaded, because of the incorrectly engineered bracket.  Once you finally get it threaded, it starts to bend the metal out.  Like the other poster mentioned, the self tapping screws are barely long enough and you have to be very delicate while drilling and set the clutch on the drill low so you don't drill out the hole completely like I did on my first hole.  I'm not convinced it will hold.  I may tack weld the brackets on if it gets loose.  I'm not thrilled about drilling holes in my truck.  There are plenty of factory holes and options that should have been utilized.  I wish I had gone with a different option/brand.  With stressed metal and questionable self tapped screws, not sure how long this will last.  I'm pretty sure I will need to weld these on at some point, if I don't just rip them off and start with a different brand.  This is on a 2001 F150 supercrew. ",Wrong Size

The product page makes no mention of whether the item is new or not. Part of the item had paint that easily rubbed off indicating that it was painted and an area that should not have seen paint. Also one of the end caps was fitted crooked. Finally, it did not fit my truck. I verified using the tool provided as well as going to Monroe website directly to make sure it fit my 1987 LandCruiser. I had to modify the shocks because the bolts inserts were too small. It made my truck bouncy on city streets, but seemed better off-road.

" I purchased these Monroe quick-struts 2 1/2 years ago to replace a broken coil spring on my wife's 02 Focus (a common problem for that vintage Focus, thanks Ford). They were ideal for my situation because I got the whole spring/strut assembly for about what I would have paid for just springs. As a bonus, I didn't have to mess around with compressing the springs, as it was just a matter of bolting the new assembly into place. They were an exact replacement fit and they ride the same as the stock spring/struts (note: the car seemed to ride 'higher' for a few months, but the springs have since settled in). I would have reviewed them earlier but after installing them, I began hearing faint suspension related noises and held off until I tracked down the source. That turned out to be a failing motor mount (again, thanks Ford). Long story short, I completely forgot to review these struts. So with the hindsight of 2 1/2 years and 28,000 miles, I can report they are still working beautifully. No leaks at the struts, springs are in good shape, and an overall stock like handling suspension. ",Correct Size/

However I bought this product because I liked how my last set performed. These feel wonderful: firm control, great jitter absorption and help with sway. They raised the rear ride-height just a touch.

 the seller was great.  The product arrived right away in new condition.  Packaging was not damaged.  Product was well packaged. One issue out of many parts ordered. One of the shocks had a factory defect in which the metal sleeves were not completely pressed into position within the rubber bushing.  They were left sticking out 1/4   on one side and recessed on other side.  The defect was found on both ends of the shock. This made the ends of the shock too large to fit within the vehicle mounting brackets.  Luckily I was able to press the sleeves into place with an arbor press and use the product. ,Correct Size/

I'm use to a rough and loud ride, i figured these mounts cant make that much of a difference, its not like I'm use to driving a Cadillac, Wow was I wrong. After two weeks, i pulled these out today and installed new regular rubber mounts.Good:  these inserts fit perfectly into the stock mounts, even though one of my mounts was completely torn into two pieces. They are easy to install and fit securely into the mounts. They are a good product.Bad: These inserts basically turn your mounts into solid mounts. Every Vibration from the engine transferred directly to the cars body.  This isnt to bad at cruising speed, but was terrible at idle.  At stoplights, my front bumper rattled, the steering wheel shook, Sunroof cover rattled, the change in my center console danced around, etc...  On top of that there was a heavy drone inside the car, from the lack of sound deadening, coupled with the vibration.Opinion:  If you need solid mounts for a high power car/race car, and you dont care about excessive noise, these are perfect for you.  If you need new mounts for the car you drive everyday, spend the money and get new rubber mounts, you will be much happier. ",Wrong Size Correct

The passenger side mirror was broken, and was replaced, but the remote control would not function except to move the mirrors up.I looked here and found this switch.  I was encouraged because in appearance it was an almost perfect match for the switch I needed to replace.  The only difference was that my existing switch had black buttons, and this one was grey.  When I attemtped to order it, the drop down menus to check compatability appeared at the top of the page, asking for year, make, and model of the vehicle.  When that information was entered, the system advised that this switch would not fit my vehicle.  None of the other switches shown were even close in appearance.  I took a chance and ordered the switch anyway.  It arrived today, and except for color was an exact match of my exisitng switch.  It took less than 5 minutes to exchange the switches, and the mirrors worked perfectly.  I suggest that the compatability feature be looked at, and readjusted.  According to the system, this was not the proper switch for my vehicle, when in fact, it was. ",Wrong Size

I called local dealer and the price was $89.00 plus tax. I found this direct replacement for my c90  for $14.00  free shipping. After installing this relay my bike started right up I am very satisfied and have ordered another one to have as spare which I carry in my tool bag. Better safe than sorry. If your bike clicks when you press the start button but does not start give this a try. I had been told by several mechanics that the starter needed to be replaced but after several web searches I decided to give this a try. I ran a wire from positive side of battery direct to starter and bike would crank up so that led me to believe that it was the relay. I love it when I'm right.

" I installed this kit on my BMW.  It went together smoothly and the clutch pedal feels almost the same as it did with the dual-mass flywheel I removed.Now the but,Shipped in the kit is an incorrect pilot bearing.  Consequently, the alignment tool is also incorrect.  The inside diameter of the shipped pilot bearing was too small.  I had to find the right pilot bearing locally.Now, the pilot bearing itself is only $12-$15 (and the right size alignment tool won't cost much either--I wrapped duct tape on mine to make it the right size and everything lined up pretty easily), so don't let that stop you from ordering this otherwise perfect way to get rid of your clunky dual-mass OEM flywheel, which you should probably not resurface anyway!

It is hard to shift fast enough with the 350z shifter to keep the RPMs up during shifting.  The 350z is definitely designed with the stock dual mass flywheel in mind. ",Correct Size/
" DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It is totally garbage! I had to replace the oil cooler lines on my 2000 Blazer, so I found this piece of crap(didn't know at the time). I removed the old one because it was leaking where the steel met the rubber. First of all, when I went to install the new one, (mind you, this is a   direct fit   part)one of the hoses kinked....are you kidding me???!!! So anyway, I used about 5 zip ties around that area to prevent it from kinking. I installed this part in October, 2011. Here it is April, 2012, I decided to do an oil change and when I went to replace the filter, I looked up through the access door, and this   wonderful   piece of automotive engineering looked like it was about 100 years old! The rubber part of the assembly was all dried out, cracked, and starting to leak. I suppose I could get a replacement under warranty, but I don't want to get stuck doing this job again in another 6 months. The original one lasted for 160,000 miles. Just goes to show, when it says   made in China  , it's junk. Unfortunately, 90% of everything in this country is made in China nowadays. Looks like I'll have to go to the dealer   pay an arm   a leg if I want it to last. I will NEVER buy anything manufactured by Dorman ever again! ",Wrong Size.

" I just finished installing this part.  While it may be as good as original, I can't rate it any better for the following reasons:  As other reviewers noted, it is different from original, there are NO instructions, and it is missing parts (2 nuts as mentioned in other reviews).  Some may be smarter or luckier than me, but I found it to be a royal pain to figure out correct angle/installation.  As for the references to YouTube instructions, from what I found (and I looked) there are no videos that cover the most difficult part of job: how to fit in a part that looks considerably different from the one you just removed.  For those who are where I was 2 hours ago:- Get the 2 nuts (10 mm) before you try to install new part.- Attach the arm (to left) with the protruding bolts through door w/ new nuts.- Once this is in place, it may be easier to figure out how to attach part (it DOES fit).- When in place properly, the motor should sit in upper right corner, pointing straight up,  if you are looking at it straight on (as if you could see through the door panel); if you look down from above, you see the cylinder shape of top of motor).- The four original bolts (in rectangular pattern) will go in place once it is sitting properly.- You will have 3 extra bolts from original that aren't needed .Good luck.

" I ordered the regulator to replace the one in my 2001 Chevy Silverado passengers door. The part arrived just as promised by Amazon. Opening the box I found the regulator, a piece of paper with information type on it describing the possible changes from the OEM part.  A small plastic bag with two nuts and a bolt in it. I removed the door panel. Taped the window and removed all the bolts. Removed the old regulator. Just as I figured the control cable had rusted and broken. I compared the new one to the OEM. On the bottom of the regulator where there was two bolts, there are welded studs on the new one.. Also, a support bracket mid way on the right side of the part is not present on the new one. It installed with ease. Studs lined up, all bolts lined up with no problems. Window clamps appeared to be the same as the OEM and tightened to the glass. Powered up and a few test runs all appeared to be fine. Time will tell.The paper work explained the difference of the OEM and the replacement with pictures, its a copy, but readable.I hope the missing support on the right side of the frame does not cause any problem later but time will tell. The paper work shows a picture and explains the missing point of contact.If you want to review the removal/installation of the door regulator, there's lots of videos online to show you the proper way to repair your regulator.The up/down speed appeared normal and non-laboredThis is an easy repair for the mechanically challenged.It took about an hour or so.

" I bought a pair of these to replace the disintegrating OEM blades on a 2006 E91 BMW 325xi. Installation wasn't the easiest, as BMW, in its infinite complicating wisdom, uses a special pin mount instead of the usual U-hook. Attachment involved removing a piece from the blade mount, and forcing the slightly-too-small pin hole on the blade onto the slightly-too-large pin on the wiper arm. (There are two pin holes on the wiper mount: a little too small, and way too large.)Note that these blades are reversible on their mounts, to match the curvature of your windshield. The blade carrier separates from the piece that attaches to the wiper arm, and can be reattached facing either left or right. Until I figured this out, the left blade kept a triangle of windshield directly in front of the driver's face un-wiped. I'm guessing that this is probably in the manual, so do read it.As with other Rain-X blades I've installed on other cars, these wipe with the best. ",Wrong Size

" Love the Bosch wiper blades. The Evolution series are the best, as they have a cap that swings down and covers the entire insertion area of the wiper. Makes removing the wiper, later on, much easier, because the cap keeps dirt etc. out of the wiper to wiper arm connection area. Unfortunately, these do not fit the rear window of the Subaru Forester 2005, as Amazon's car part finder suggested. The size of the blade is correct, but the connector is wrong.The blade needs to have a large round plastic dowel across the middle of the insertion area, so that the dowel swings up into place on the car's wiper connector arm. The rear window of the 2005 Subaru Forester does not have the standard   push it on the hook of the connector arm   setup. The Advantage series is the same as the Evolution series minus the protection cap, so these should be an excellent blade overall. ",Wrong Size
" Unfortunately for me these are one of the only 2 brands that make a replacement wiper blades for my 2006 Toyota Avalon. They were the cheaper of the 2 (the other being rain-x) but only by a few dollars. They are by far the worst brand I have ever purchased. They make this god awful squeal if the windows aren't completely saturated. Even with my intermittent wipers I cannot find a speed that will stop the noise when it's not raining that hard. After only a few months they wore out too. Plus they were a pain in the ads to change! I have had better luck with the cheap Walmart brand wipers than these. I was very disappointed. Won't be buying this brand again, I will spend the extra cash on the rain-x brand next time! ",Wrong Size.

" It was with GREAT anticipation that I waited for my opportunity to acquire my Valeo Frameless ULTIMATE All-Season  22 #34; Wiper.  The stories of prowess shared by my fore-fathers were legendary.  My mother spoke of Valeo, himself, as the master of all wipers and was clearly the most superior at removing debris from surfaces.In driving through my neighborhood, I saw the drone lifting off from my neighbor's front yard.  Upon closer look, I saw a glow of light from the sky shining down on the box.  It was as though the heavens were shining down on the very cardboard box containing my 22 #34; wiper.  As I reached the front porch, I quickly realized the wiper must be inside.  (Of course, I realized this after I put the box in my car and drove directly home and into my garage, where I ripped open the box with my bare hands.)I have acquired many smiley face boxes in a similar manner, but this one was the box of all boxes.  Upon opening the box, the 22 #34; wiper instantly flew from the opening and began rubbing across my car.  The rust bubbles and mud disappeard, then i noticed the paint shined like new. I have no idea how it worked that magic, but it was as though Frosty the Snowman, himself, was behind it.  I thought 22 #34; wipers were only for glass windsheilds, but this 22 #34; one... this ULTIMATE All-Season Valeo 22 #34; wiper was not only 'All-Season,' but it was also 'All-Car' and 'All Miracle! #34;As it glided across the paint, scratches vanished.  Across the chrome, all pitting removed.  I was astonished to see rubber actually re-appear on the tire tread as it gently stroked across it.  By the time the wiper finished, my car not only looked new again, it was a completely different color.I assure you that if you buy this wiper, and use it on your car, you will be more than thrilled.WARNING:  Use on your wife at your own risk.  After seeing how it made my car look new, I could not help but wonder if it could do the same for my wife.  After using it on my wife, (just a light touch), she was transformed to the beautiful woman I married all those years ago.  Her body was all firm and tight with skin as beautiful and smooth as a baby's skin.  Unfornately, she took one look in the mirror and instantly left me for my neighbor who had ordered the 24 #34; wiper.  I never realized she would leave me just to get a man who had 2 more inches.

" These have to be the best wiper blades on the market.  I had purchased them for my previous car a couple of years ago, and now that my newer vehicle was needing wipers, of course I wanted Bosch Icons.

Luckily for me I found them here on Amazon, ordered them Sunday and they arrived today (Friday), even after the seller said there would be a delay because they were awaiting their shipment.  I put them on right away, and they work like a dream.  My windshield is so clear it looks as if it has been replaced as well.

With these, the window is just clean and there's nothing there to distract.DISCLAIMER: I know very little about wiper blades.

" My car uses the 20A on the passenger side and the 26A on the drivers side.This blade is easy to install, and that's half the battle. Before you order from Amazon, be sure to use the pop-up link to find the proper size for your vehicle. The blades come in both A and B sizes and different lengths. Some vehicles take different lengths for each side of the wind-shield. My Ford Edge takes the 26 A and the 20A.  I did not see a size listed on the website for the rear window wiper.I went to the Bosch web site before installing and they have a wonderful, helpful video about installation. Just search it under   wiper blades   on their site. Lots of helpful information there, for someone who never had to change their old blades. The packaging was simple to open after seeing the video. No need for box cutters or scissors like some over packaged goods.Another helpful hint from the video is to place a towel on the windshield in case the blade snaps out of your hand. (prevent a cracked windshield). You are also told the some vehicles require the blade to be in a vertical position before replacing, so sit in the car and turn on the wiper until it is upright. I know it sounds simple to you mechanical types, but tips like these mean a lot to those of us who were used to Service Stations actually giving service and when the local gas station attendant would check your wipers if asked.This is a good product, works well and is easy to do it yourself.

" First, these blades are priced on the economical side so you will not get the sleek look of an expensive blade.  Personally, that is not something that matters to me, I am more concerned with performance and ease of installation.  I replaced my Altima's worn blades with this 17 #34; blade and a 28 #34; blade from this series. I was very happy with the 28 #34; blade but found performance of the 17 #34; blade to be just ok.First, installation was pretty simple.  I am not mechanical but I replaced both blades in about 5 minutes. However, the 17 #34; blades did not seem to have enough tension to lie flat on the windshield and left a lot of streaking where the last four inches of the blade met the glass.  I bent the blade a bit and that helped but there was still some streaking.  Not a lot but this is not an issue I've had with other 17 #34; replacement blades.  This is often a problem with the 28 #34; blades. Oddly, the 28 #34; companion blade worked very well! No streaking for that one. So, ok performance but nothing fantastic. ",Wrong Size

I should also point out that these wipers are noise free. We're very pleased with the performance and highly recommend this high quality wiper. ",Correct Size/
" Agreeing with some critiques, the part that hooks onto the wiper arm is very bulky and is an eyesore.  The blade itself is low profile (as is with the new curved, steel-scaffolding-less wipers) but it is completely offset by the ugly plastic hump that joins the blade to the arm.  I was able to modify it to make it look far better than what it originally came as.  Be warned though that the stated lengths may not have the same exact proportions as the OEM-type wiper blades.  Some customers stated that the wipers are too short in some areas where it leaves a larger triangle left in the middle or they are too long that the blades nick eachother while being operated.  These are still good wipers with some shortcomings, thankfully of which did not affect me.Tips, I keep an older set of wipers on my car in the summertime because I may rarely use them.  I keep these on in the wintertime just because they are a bit pricier and don't want them to wear out so soon.  The older OEM style wipers can be refilled with just the rubber piece.  Once the Valeo ones go bad, you have to purchase the whole blade.  Summertime conditions can dry out and wear the rubber much faster.  At least the cold and perhaps wetter winter seasons can keep the rubber edges from going bad. ",Wrong Size

It is pre-curved and basically one piece. The curved blade is part of a curved frame that simply attaches to the wiper arm.Installation took about a minute. The hardest part was getting the Rain-X blade out of the package. Sprayed some Rain-x water repellent on the windshield after installing this (and a slightly different Rain-X blade for the passenger side -- smaller and not available in the Latitude series). The results were great. The blades moved across the windshield glass perfectly. No gaps, no streaks, no noise. I think the graphite coating on the Latitude makes a big difference.

" This is the first wiper of this type that I have used (non-hinged frame type) and I have to say that I am impressed.

" First of all, all of the reviewers that gave these a negative review before me are all nuts. I've been using these for around a week or so now, and they are by far the best wiper blades you can buy (if you can really get excited about wiper blades). They are very sturdy, hug the windshield smoothly and evenly, and create a streak-free wipe every time, no matter how hard it rains. I have yet to test these in the winter, but with their frame-less design, I doubt these will under-preform. The only reasons I would believe some people don't like these are because those people are either cheap (These are about double the cost of regular blades, but are definitely worth it) or they don't use the Rain-X Windshield Treatment in addition to these. Like with Rain-X Washer Fluid, even though it doesn't mention this on the bottle, if you don't use the Rain-X Treatment along with it, it will make your windshield even dirtier after using it. It wasn't until I used the Rain-X Treatment along with the Washer Fluid until the product worked like a charm. The Rain-X Windshield Treatment does an awesome job at increasing visibility during showers, so it's a good thing to use anyways. If you're looking to get new blades, these are the best you can get, and will produce much better results than standard wiper blades. ",Correct Size/

No big deal practically, but annoying.2) When driving fast on the freeway, there was one time, maybe because of heavy wind, the driver side wiper actually lifted - as in, not touching the glass.  This happened on one side.  When compared to the OEM blade, the OEM frame is a lot heavier, and has a contraption that seems like an airfoil.  Maybe this is why.

" I'm comparing this to a   premium   Michelin wiper blade I had installed previously on my Civic, which I had purchased at the local Wal*Mart, and I think it holds up quite nicely. First of all, they both have a bracketless construction which prevents chunks of ice from getting stuck between the arms which would otherwise cause the wiper to become ineffective. Come blizzard time here in New England, that will be much appreciated.  This wiper installed more easily than the Michelin; the default mounting bracket worked perfectly and there was only one way--the correct way--to snap the blade onto my wiper arm. In addition, the mounting bracket is somewhat closed to the elements, and should prevent ice and other foreign objects from getting lodged there.So, I would characterize this wiper as well and thoughtfully constructed.[Update: wiper failed when the blade shredded after 2,5 years of service, pretty good as these things go.]As for the breast cancer awareness ribbon logo, it is clearly visible to the driver.
